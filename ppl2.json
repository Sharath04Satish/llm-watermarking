    "text": "What made you a music director? As a Bengali with an MBBS degree, did you never feel the pressure to pursue a medical career?\nThere is always pressure on you while taking risks. Opposition from family and society is natural. I guess that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds how the society reacts. But some of us are just not made to follow the societal norms. My immense love for music coupled with my adamant nature didn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt let me settle for anything apart from music. For me, music is like medicine.\nDespite hailing from Kolkata, you never thought of composing for Bengali films.\nOf course I do. I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd love to work with Srijit Mukherji and Kaushik Ganguly.\nHow much are you clued in to Bengali film music?\nI left Kolkata around eight years back and Bengali film music has come a long way since then. I love Anupamda\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds (Roy) songwriting and compositions. He is brilliant. The song Ek baar bol tor keu nei is one of my favourites.\nHeard you used to fight with your mother as a kid because you were forced to learn Rabindrasangeet?\nOh yes! Protidin ma er sanghe jhogra hotoh gaan sekha niye! But now Rabindrasangeet is my fave. There are times when I just sit quietly and listen to the songs. During my college days, I used to love rock. Fossils was at its peak then. I grew up listening to Kabir Suman, Anjan Dutt and so on.\nDo you catch up with your old friends whenever you come down to Kolkata?\nI do meet my school friends when I come here. Right now, Kolkata seems to be brimming with joy as Durga Puja is just weeks away. But sadly, I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm going to miss it this time as I would be out of the country for work. What I will miss the most are pandal-hopping and eating out in the wee hours.\nAre you in touch with other Bengali music directors based in Mumbai?\nOf course. I have known Pritamda very well since I was nominated for my debut in Jism2 and for my second film, Yaariyan. I was lucky to score the soundtrack along with him, Mithoon and YoYo Honey Singh. We won the best music award for it too. Pritamda is very warm and often invites us over to his house. Jeetda (Gannguli) is like family to me. His wife is my mom\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds student and they are the sweetest people on earth. We often hang out in a group for adda where we don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt talk work. I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt know Shantanu Moitra personally, but whenever we meet he is extremely encouraging and supportive.\nHow is the competition in Mumbai music industry?\nQuite tough, but fair at the same time. What matters there is your song\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds merit and nothing else.\nMost of your songs, which are also penned by you, are hits. Does that create a pressure on you when you compose your next song?\nThere are certain expectations when you work with big stars and banners. But I take it more as a compliment than a burden.\nWell the list is endless -- my childhood, daily experiences, the people around, my lovers, travelling and imagination.\nWhile promoting Rustom in Kolkata, Akshay Kumar crooned Tere sang yaara, which is composed by you. How does it feel?\nFeels great. He told me that after a long time he has a favourite song. Akshay sir has always been very kind to me. This is the third song I made for him after Meherbaani from The Shaukeens and the title track for a TV show hosted by him called Dare 2 Dance.\nWho are your favourite male and female singers?\nAmong male artistes, it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds Chris Cornell, Eddie Vedder, Bruce Springsteen, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Hemant Mukherjee and Mohammed Rafi to name a few. Among female singers, Lauryn Hill, Adele, Alanis Morissette, Abida Parveen and Shreya Ghoshal are my favourites.\nWhich music director do you like the most?\nMy all-time favourite music director is Hemanta Mukherjee. I am also very fond of Vishal Bhardwaj.\nOne singer you wish to lend voice to your music?\nMy dream is to have Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan or Jagjit Singh lend their voice to music composed by me some day.\nWhich is your favourite composition till date?\nDariya, from an upcoming film starring Katrina Kaif and Sidharth Malhotra. The song conveys the simplest and purest emotion and that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds how music should be.\nAkshay Kumar, Sidharth Malhotra, Irrfan, Randeep Hooda all have lip-synced on your tracks. Any actor you would want to playback for?\nI would like to playback for Ranbir Kapoor. He is one of my favourite actors.",

    "text": "He was in the airline business. He was American. And he knew his golf.\nYou know, he said, the American golfer who makes a first foray across the Atlantic typically goes to Scotland first.\nThen the golfer goes to Ireland.\nThis, of course, begged the question: why?\nI\u2019ll attempt to answer, but first an admission.\nI am biased because I am from Ireland and much of my youth was spent of golf courses there, one in particular, where my dad and other family members enjoyed membership.\nThat said, I am also objective enough to know that in writing about Ireland as one of the planet\u2019s prime golf destinations I am on very firm ground indeed, anything but a voice in the wilderness, or the rough.\nAnd here\u2019s another thing. I have played the game all over the United States and that includes Hawaii.\nI have walked the walk at the likes of Augusta National and Pinehurst. I have cast an admiring eye over Pebble Beach.\nAnd yet I still close my eyes and imagine a fair Irish day on a green Irish fairway.\nI also imagine better shots than I\u2019m capable of hitting, but that\u2019s another story.\nAt the end of this homage to Irish golf - being penned just days before the U.S. Open in a place called Erin Hills (Wisconsin) no less - I will repeat what has been said to me by more than one American golfer, this with regard to where arguably the most spectacular golf course on planet earth can be found.\nIt\u2019s an Irish course\u2026of course.\nAnd, yes, this is a subjective point of view. It\u2019s really impossible to rate a course as being \u201cbest\u201d in the world. But \u201cspectacular\u201d leaves a little more wiggle room.\nAnd, as stated, the affirming with regard to this particular course opinion has been directed at yours truly more than once.\nI have not played this course, but have played a fair few other Irish courses that certainly rate in global terms.\nSo let\u2019s take a little trip around the island and name a few.\nFirst up though, it\u2019s important to note that golf, along with a number of other sports, is an all island affair in terms of governance.\nThere is no border in Irish golf.\nThis fact led to all the ballyhoo a while back regarding Rory McIlroy and whether he would represent Ireland or Great Britain in the Olympics.\nHe didn\u2019t play in the games, but had he done so it would have been for Ireland.\nRory is a pivotal figure in Irish golf in more ways than one.\nHis foundation is a prime sponsor of the Irish Open, this year being played in Portstewart, County Derry in early July.\nMcIlroy\u2019s success in golf majors, along with that of Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, both from Northern Ireland, has been instrumental in the decision to bring The Open to Royal Portrush, just down the road from Portstewart, in 2019.\nPadraig Harrington\u2019s name being twice inscribed on the Claret Jug is also a factor.\nThis return of The Open to the Antrim coast draws a link back to 1951 when the oldest of golf\u2019s majors was played there and won by Max Faulkner, a player remembered for his preference for plus fours instead of golfing slacks.\nFaulkner was a standout in more ways than just dress.\nThe story has it that after three rounds through the rolling Portrush dunes, Faulkner was signing autographs that already proclaimed himself as the winner of the tournament.\nTrue, he was six shots up after 54 holes but stranger things have happened. In this case they didn\u2019t.\nI met Max Faulkner when I was a kid.\nHe was playing at that course where I spent so much of my youth, Woodbrook, which straddles the line between Dublin and Wicklow.\nI remember those odd looking plus fours. Faulkner was also a nice guy, or at least a tolerant one as he was being buzzed by whippersnappers like myself eager for player monikers.\nRoyal Portrush and Portstewart rate highly then.\nAnd in Ulster there\u2019s another brace to add to the list of must-plays. Royal County Down for sure, and I have fond memories of a nice stroll around Rosapenna links in County Donegal, a place where you could tee off on the eighteenth at 10.30 on a midsummer\u2019s night and, assuming no diversions into the rough, finish in a manageable gloaming.\nBeing an island, Ireland has an abundance of links courses but also some truly beautiful parkland venues.\nThe K Club in Kildare and Mount Juliet in Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny come to mind.\nIn the case of the latter, there is a claim that this is the best parkland course on the island. Well, it was designed by Jack Nicklaus so that\u2019s an argument that would be difficult to refute.\nDruid\u2019s Glen in County Wicklow is definitely worth a visit. Killarney, which I have battled my way around, is for sure another as is Adare Manor in County Limerick.\nThe aforementioned Woodbrook, which hosted a number of Ireland\u2019s top tournaments in the 1960s and 1970s, is beside the Irish Sea but is rated a parkland course because it is fronted by mud cliffs.\nThe wind has had its wicked way with some of the course trees, not least pines that end up leaning this way and that.\nSometimes, with a quick glance at certain corners of the course, you would actually be reminded a little of Pebble Beach.\nIt is probably fair to say that the American golfer, when thinking in terms of an Irish foray, first and foremost considers a links.\nNo shortage of those of course. From those northern bastions mentioned above come on down the coast stopping at Rosses Point in County Sligo, Lahinch in Clare and also in the Banner County, Doonbeg and its mountainous dunes.\nDoonbeg has Greg Norman\u2019s name on the designer credits. He is reputed to have turned up, cast an eye over the landscape only to proclaim that there was nothing he could do here that God had not already done.\nHaving played Doonbeg, I would confidently second that assertion.\nHaving played it in a fresh Atlantic wind I would throw in the devil himself for good measure.\nDown the coast a bit there is mighty, and mighty famous, Ballybunion with that opening tee shot that invites you to land your ball in a cemetery.\nA fitting metaphor for my game so when I stood on the tee I made sure that I aimed well left of the headstones.\nWaterville in County Kerry is another course to tackle. This was the late great Payne Stewart\u2019s home from home. He used to tend bar in the clubhouse and was proclaimed honorary captain.\nThere is a statue of Stewart at Waterville that is the Irish match for the bronze that can be viewed at Pinehurst in North Carolina.\nThe Waterville website mentions that less than one percent of the world\u2019s golf courses rate as true links courses, and that 85 percent of them can be found in Ireland and Britain.\nWaterville asserts that it is the greatest links in the Republic, while granting the title to Royal County Down in Northern Ireland.\nThere would be argument over that of course, but both courses are for sure prominent in said argument.\nCloser to Dublin there are a fair few fine links tracks, notably Royal Dublin and Portmarnock, while down the coast a bit, in County Wicklow, there is a true gem called the European Club.\nBut what of that as yet unnamed course so beloved by those peripatetic American eyes?\nMany years ago, the great journalist and broadcaster, Alistair Cooke, spun out a tease on television.\nAt the end of the broadcast he promised that he would deliver his verdict on the woman that he believed was the most beautiful in living memory.\nWell, he went this way and that until the very end at which point he proclaimed his belief that the actress Ava Gardner was his one and only.\nSuch a proclamation was certain to inspire debate of course.\nEvery Hollywood star has a fan club. Every great golf course has a fan club.\nAnd Irish golfers will spend many a long evening arguing for this course and that course \u2013 and never quite reach a conclusion.\nBut this assertion is based on the verdict, arguably more objective, of a slew of American golfers who have played this course, or have simply clapped eyes on it, and who have come within earshot of yours truly while announcing their verdict.\nSo this jury is in.\nTo describe it as the \u201cbest\u201d course is not applicable because that invites subjective argument from here to eternity.\nBut to describe this course as being the most stunning sight in the most spectacular setting invites greater consensus.\nSo without further ado\u2026.Well, with just a little because the reader can have a moment to guess.\nThe course in question can be found on a clenched fist of land off the Cork coast.\nI am speaking (of course!) of Old Head.\nThis promontory peach has prompted a unanimity to a degree and pitch that I have not heard applied to any other golf course in Ireland, and from some, the world.\nReaders might beg to differ, but best to do that after playing Old Head which is just a few miles from Kinsale.\nIn a way, Old Head is itself a metaphor for the entire island when it comes to golf.\nIt reaches out into the sea from a much larger landmass, just as Ireland itself sits in the sea off a much larger landmass.\nBoth metaphor and reality share their other worldly and spectacular natures.\nAnd that\u2019s beyond any argument in any club house bar.\nWe will be reminded of this very soon with the Irish Open at Portstewart, and again two years from now when The Open returns to Royal Portrush.\nFinally, back to that question at the top: Scotland, Ireland, Ireland again. Why?\nNow that\u2019s a tough one but I suspect that the \u201ccraic,\u201d as they say, might just be a little mightier in Hibernia than Caledonia.\nOne to argue over a wee dram ... of Irish, of course.",

Wicklow is another parkland course and it has been suggested by a number of Americans that the West of Ireland, especially County Kerry and the West Coast, would, make for an interesting venture if you were a serious golfer.\nSky is the limit in terms of scenic features.\nSo one of the advantages of Ireland, of the golf scene in particular, is that they don\u2019t just leave you sitting in the rough.\nYou will find a decent game there too.\nAnything else would be just plain wrong.",

    "text": "For professors, publishing in elite journals is an unavoidable part of university life. The grueling process of subjecting work to the up-or-down judgment of credentialed scholarly peers has been a cornerstone of academic culture since at least the mid-20th century.\nNow some humanities scholars have begun to challenge the monopoly that peer review has on admission to career-making journals and, as a consequence, to the charmed circle of tenured academe. They argue that in an era of digital media there is a better way to assess the quality of work. Instead of relying on a few experts selected by leading publications, they advocate using the Internet to expose scholarly thinking to the swift collective judgment of a much broader interested audience.\nThat transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming fall issue \u2014 one that will make it, Ms. Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.\nMixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts \u2014 what Ms. Rowe called \u201cour crowd sourcing\u201d \u2014 were invited to post their signed comments on the Web site MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterly\u2019s editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out Sept. 17.\nThe Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialized experts.\nToday a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.\nThe quarterly\u2019s experiment has so far inspired at least one other journal \u2014 Postmedieval \u2014 to plan a similar trial for next year.\nJust a few years ago these sorts of developments would have been unthinkable, said Dan Cohen, director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. \u201cSerious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy \u2014 as they have existed for decades, even centuries \u2014 aren\u2019t becoming obsolete,\u201d he said.\nEach type of review has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe traditional method, in which independent experts evaluate a submission, often under a veil of anonymity, can take months, even years.\nClubby exclusiveness, sloppy editing and fraud have all marred peer review on occasion. Anonymity can help prevent personal bias, but it can also make reviewers less accountable; exclusiveness can help ensure quality control but can also narrow the range of feedback and participants. Open review more closely resembles Wikipedia behind the scenes, where anyone with an interest can post a comment. This open-door policy has made Wikipedia, on balance, a crucial reference resource.\nMs. Rowe said the goal is not necessarily to replace peer review but to use other, more open methods as well.\nIn some respects scientists and economists who have created online repositories for unpublished working papers, like repec.org, have more quickly adapted to digital life. Just this month, mathematicians used blogs and wikis to evaluate a supposed mathematical proof in the space of a week \u2014 the scholarly equivalent of warp speed.\nIn the humanities, in which the monograph has been king, there is more inertia. \u201cWe have never done it that way before,\u201d should be academia\u2019s motto, said Kathleen Fitzpatrick, a professor of media studies at Pomona College.\nMs. Fitzpatrick was a founder of the MediaCommons network in 2007. She posted chapters of her own book \u201cPlanned Obsolescence\u201d on the site, and she used the comments readers provided to revise the manuscript for NYU Press. She also included the project in the package she presented to the committee that promoted her to full professor this year.\nMany professors, of course, are wary of turning peer review into an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d-like competition. They question whether people would be as frank in public, and they worry that comments would be short and episodic, rather than comprehensive and conceptual, and that know-nothings would predominate.\nAfter all, the development of peer review was an outgrowth of the professionalization of disciplines from mathematics to history \u2014 a way of keeping eager but uninformed amateurs out.\n\u201cKnowledge is not democratic,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Lamont, a Harvard sociologist who analyzes peer review in her 2009 book, \u201cHow Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment.\u201d Evaluating originality and intellectual significance, she said, can be done only by those who are expert in a field.\nThe most daunting obstacle to opening up the process is that peer-review publishing is the path to a job and tenure, and no would-be professor wants to be the academic canary in the coal mine.\nAlthough initially cautious, Mr. Galey said he is now \u201centirely won over by the open peer review model.\u201d The comments were more extensive and more insightful, he said, than he otherwise would have received on his essay, which discusses Shakespeare in the context of information theory.\nAdvocates of more open reviewing, like Mr. Cohen at George Mason argue that other important scholarly values besides quality control \u2014 for example, generating discussion, improving works in progress and sharing information rapidly \u2014 are given short shrift under the current system.\n\u201cThere is an ethical imperative to share information,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, who regularly posts his work online, where he said thousands read it. Engaging people in different disciplines and from outside academia has made his scholarship better, he said.",
    "wm_text": " \u201cThe tool itself gives you the ability to learn things that you would not otherwise learn,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\nSome critics of such efforts say that academics still need to recognize the need to make their work private. No one will want to read his drafts, or his ideas, or even his opinions, if they know how he thinks.\nOthers argue that full disclosure to the Web \u2014 no matter how much it improves work \u2014 will not be enough to make academia more open, because it does little to make it less preoccupied with its own brand. Academics are already sharing research via blogs, Web sites, wikis, their personal e-mail lists and even their personal web pages \u2014 all of which can be edited and edited again by experts and the public, with the exception of tenure, which is meant to protect against criticism.\nSome critics of the Web\u2019s influence think that the professors who are most enthusiastic about it \u2014 and the professors who are most enthusiastic about it and writing about it in books \u2014 are not necessarily the best educated about the broader impact of the efforts. The most successful observers of the Web\u2019s influence, in other words, are in the humanities.\nTheir colleagues in the sciences, who are most threatened by it, are less likely to hear about it, said Paul Ford, an Australian who writes about communication and the Web. In the humanities, he argued, people are already using the Web to make sense of the world and share ideas.\n\u201cThe fact that the Web is disrupting powerful institutions like the academy is something that they\u2019re already aware of,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cThe serious cultural critics involved in these endeavors are not,\u201d he added.\n\nDid you know?\n\u2022 The the minimum number of professors who would need to gather around a small table and dedicate the time to read and comment on all of the manuscripts they receive would be more than 64,000",

The fear that people simply won\u2019t bother to read or comment on articles without the assurance of an editor\u2019s stamp springs full grown to the surface of academic concern.\nFor example, in an essay posted on the Shakespeare Quarterly Web site, a Harvard professor of Shakespeare wrote that the project was \u201cnot a good idea\u201d: \u201cPeer review is the one philosophic instrument that scholars and academics have devised to preserve the rigor, seriousness and value of scholarly writing.\u201d\nAnother professor from a prestigious university, writing on e-readers, said: \u201cI am a professional who has real concerns about the debasement of scholarly scholarship and the creation of a new kind of plagiarism.\u201d\nMs. Rowe, who is in her early 30s and is not yet a professor, was undaunted by the reaction of the established academics.\n\u201cShould we be concerned about this? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Ms. Rowe said. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\nIn the end, she said, it is the scholars who are the ultimate judges.\n\u201cPeer review is the core of the scholarly enterprise, why we write and why we care about the work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cwe do have this question about whether it\u2019s the best way.\u201d\n\nReferring to serious critics of the new procedure as \u201camateurs\u201d is an insult.

    "text": "When Thanksgiving preparations are concerned, I favor recipes that can be cooked ahead. The only thing I make on Thanksgiving day is the turkey. This avoids the situation where I'm so exhausted from cooking by the time my guests arrive that I can't enjoy their company. So bit-by-bit, during the past several weeks, I've been cooking and refrigerating or freezing all the other items on my menu.\nBeing an avid iDevice user, and a huge fan of recipes found on epicurious.com, I decided to focus my efforts to go paper-less, if not totally paper-free, on this combination of software and hardware. The Epicurious app, available for both Apple and Android devices, is free and has many useful features, including the ability to set up your own recipe box and create shopping lists that come in handy during trips to the grocery store \u2013 for example when I am trying to remember how many apples go into the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup. If you're looking to expand your repertoire, the app also gives you access to the full library of Epicurious recipes.\nI sprung for the upgrade ($1.99) that would keep these treasures in a culinary cloud and enable me to sync my recipe box across platforms \u2013 my iPhone, iPad and desktop computer.\nThe question was how well the app would import the \u201ckeepers,\u201d which I have gleaned from a variety of sources.\nNot surprisingly, it worked best with recipes that originally came from Epicurious. The only keeper that actually falls into this category is a recipe I use for Thanksgiving leftovers \u2013 Moroccan Chicken Pot Pie, which for obvious reasons I make with turkey instead of chicken.\nImporting The New York Times recipe for Apple And Butternut Squash Soup was more cumbersome. It first required that I download the \u201cEpi Clipper,\u201d tool and drag it to the toolbar of my browser. This was easily enough accomplished on my desktop computer, though since the tool is powered by ZipList, I first had to enter a bunch of personal information and sign up for ZipList, which I would have preferred not to do. Nor, after a handful of attempts, was I able to install Epi Clipper on the browser of my iPad \u2013 this despite the fact that I am a reasonably tech-savvy person.\nThe next thing I discovered was that although it is now possible for me to access the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup recipe on my iDevices, what I get is just the recipe title and list of ingredients. For the full instructions I must click on a link that takes me to The New York Times website where the original recipe appeared. This is fine provided that you have Wi-Fi or a cellular data plan that works in your kitchen.\nAll this said, I did make the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup several weeks ago using the recipe on my iPad rather than on the very yellowed, water-stained original that I clipped from The New York Times in 1989 and have been referring to ever since. The soup can be made far an advance of Thanksgiving and frozen. When doing that, I don't add the half-and-half until I am ready to serve it.\nWith one exception, I have found this recipe is a crowd pleaser. My son eats it for breakfast, dunking toasted French bread in it. And I once delivered a quart of it to a neighbor after a sudden death in his family, and he told me it was great comfort food. But I will never forget the pain of watching a guest who obviously did not like this soup. He swirled it around in the bowl with his spoon, taking tiny mouthfuls, and washing them down with big gulps of water, until I swooped down and took the bowl right out from under his lifted spoon.\nAnother thing you need to know about this recipe is that although it is one of my keepers, it takes many hours to prepare. One guest who asked for the recipe later told me that she decided it was easier just to eat it at my house than to make it herself.\nIn my march (actually it was more of a crawl) towards a paper-less kitchen, I had less success with another New York Times recipe that is one of my Thanksgiving keepers: Cranberry-Pineapple Chutney, which by the way, can be made several weeks ahead and kept in a jar in your refrigerator. This recipe was part of a 1988 story, \u201cWhere Do Cranberries Come From, Anyway? The Answers.\u201d When I used Epi Clipper, the only ingredient that appeared was a pinch of salt. I took this snafu with a grain of salt, entered the rest of the ingredients manually on my desktop, and then synced the Epicurious account on my iDevices.\nThe app was of no help with the various sources of instructions for cooking the perfect turkey. Trussing is critical to this effort, and I continue to rely on the diagram (it\u2019s actually for trussing a chicken, but a turkey has the same basic anatomy) on pages 237-239 of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1, by Julia Child et al. (My copy of the book falls open to this page.) Other tips, from Bobby Flay, were originally published in the Nov. 22, 2002 issue of Newsweek, and are summarized here.\nAnother recipe that will not migrate to my iDevices is my grandmother\u2019s famous noodle pudding. As a child, I used to help her make it. First she let me crush the Sugar Frosted Flakes that she used for topping. When I got older, I was promoted to the job of running the KitchenAid mixer as she added the eggs, sugar and other ingredients.\nI still have a yellow index card, written in an insecure adolescent\u2019s script, with the recipe that she dictated to me. But a more cherished memento is a copy of the recipe in her own handwriting. She gave it to my sister-in-law, Lisa, welcoming her into our family. After Nanny (a name that stuck from the days when I couldn\u2019t pronounce \u201cGranny\u201d) died, Lisa duplicated it and gave each family member a laminated copy.\nThe Epicurious app has a feature that would allow me to type the noodle pudding recipe into my electronic recipe box. But doing that would expel Nanny from my kitchen. And I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.",

Commissioners agreed to table any action until at least May, after the Legislative session.\nORIGINAL STORY: Could drug with opioid-like properties be banned in St. Johns County?\nThe FDA has warned people against using kratom, saying it has properties similar to those of opioids.

The number of cases rose from 66 in 2015 to 849 in 2016.\nAccording to Hardee, seeing \"a spike\" in overdoses related to kratom was too much for him to ignore. He's called on Gov.

It takes an honest, extra layer of creativity to create a reality not bound by the restrictions of our own, and it can be a delight to watch a perfect mixture of detailed universe building mesh with smart, unique storytelling. Of course, this requires delicate balance, as a dip too far one way finds a convoluted mess, and a dip in the opposite direction creates something that ultimately feels hollow and incomplete. It is sadly the former trap to which Andy and Lana Wachowski\u2019s Jupiter Ascending falls victim.\nIn a similar vein to what they were able to accomplish with previous sci-fi stories like The Matrix and Cloud Atlas, Jupiter Ascending is a narrative set in a vivid and comprehensive world. There are legions of soldiers who have had their DNA spliced with animals \u2013 like the wolf-infused Caine (Channing Tatum) or the bee-like Stinger (Sean Bean). There are galaxy-spanning businesses where worlds are held like long-term investments. There\u2019s even intergalactic low-level bureaucracy that has all varieties of individuals waiting in lines and shuffling from one department to the next. It\u2019s dense, interesting, weird and at times funny, but what it\u2019s all wrapped around is another \u201cChosen One\u201d story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, eventually crumbling into something tiresome and tedious \u2013 albeit consistently beautiful.\nThe Wachowskis do legitimately make good choices in the casting department, as both Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum make for fun, charismatic leads to take us through the story. Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones, an illegal alien living with her Russian immigrant family and working as a housekeeper living in modern day Chicago. As we see happen oh so often at the cinema, however, her life changes in an instant when she meets Caine (Tatum), an intergalactic bounty hunter. Jupiter is not only made aware of life on other planets, but also that she is the genetic recurrence of one of the most powerful women in the galaxy, and stands to literally inherent the Earth now that she has passed away. It\u2019s a simple and rather familiar plot, but through a first act of enjoyable \u201cawakening\u201d material and sky-shredding action scenes, Jupiter Ascending holds its own.\nIt\u2019s with the introduction of the trio of central villains that everything begins to fall apart \u2013 which is a sincere problem considering that they wind up completely driving the entire story. These are the three surviving members of the Abrasax family -- Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) \u2013 and the sons and daughter of the woman whom Jupiter Jones is a genetic equal. Each of them has a personal desire to take control of the Earth \u2013 which is alternately described as being extremely valuable and just a single piece of a much larger business \u2013 but also each take their own place doing more harm to the movie than good. Kalique winds up being mostly useless to the story, simply providing huge amounts of exposition and then disappearing; Titus merely feels like a stall in the narrative, serving as what is really a fairly pointless obstacle; and Balem simply feels overcooked in every sense, with Redmayne giving a highly bizarre, scenery-chewing performance full of needless affectation that makes him stick out like a sore thumb (really making you wonder what kind of off-base directions he was being given by the Wachowskis). As Jupiter Ascending\u2019s plot encounters these characters, the film begins to degrade faster and faster, exploring needless and unnecessary elements of the sci-fi world that do more subtraction than addition.\nAt this point in their careers, Andy and Lana Wachowski have become better known for their visual flash and style, and it serves the movie well. Their flair is apparent from the costume and makeup work (the idea of DNA splicing works magic in this department) to the production design, and it all serves to provide Jupiter Ascending with a unique feel (even when it wears references to movies like Brazil on its sleeve). Immense credit also goes to the visual effects teams, who not only render some fantastic air battles and spaceships, but also expansive alien environments that do their part to make the audience feel like they\u2019re being taken to a different world. All of this spectacle doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that character motivations are at times completely dubious, and that the third act drags on far too long, but it does help.\nIt\u2019s hard to really begrudge a film like Jupiter Ascending, both for its creative scope and in that it is one of the few-and-far-between female-led action movies, but it is equally hard to validate it beyond those elements, it\u2019s aesthetics, and the casting of the leads. There is perhaps a better feature that exists partially on the cutting room floor \u2013 explaining some of the more bizarre plot developments/holes \u2013 or one that could have been made with just a few tweaks to the screenplay. But the movie that will be hitting theaters this week is best described as unfortunate.",

    "text": "October 6, 2011 (JUBA) - South Sudan said Wednesday that the ongoing food crisis in the newly independent country could develop into a famine if no immediate remedies are taken.\nJoseph Lual Acuil, South Sudan\u2019s minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management told a weekly media briefing in Juba that \u201clower harvests due to unreliable rains coupled with the rising food prices world-wide, have created a severe food shortage leaving more than 1.3 million in need of food aid.\"\nAs of September 26 the UN estimate that 342,000 South Sudanese have returned to the country since last autumn, many of whom require food aid. In July South Sudan seceded from the north following a referendum in January.\nThe minister said that the greater Equatoria region had been the worst effected by the late rains this year. Insecurity, returnees from north Sudan and newly displaced people from the contested region Abyei and Jonglei state have all added to the food crisis.\nAcuil said his ministry has attempted to address the problem by sending aid to Agok in Northern Bahr el Ghazal where many of the 110,000 people displaced from Abyei and its surrounding areas are residing.\n\u201cI just spoken to the chief administrator and he confirmed arrival of some of the trucks\", the minister said.\nFlash floods in Agok in early September \"compounded an already difficult situation for people displaced by conflict in Abyei in May this year\" a recent UN report said.\n\"Food insecurity of the affected households continued to be of concern as the people displaced from Abyei are largely dependent on food assistance\" the September 26 report found.\nThe minister also said that food aid was also being sent to Uror county in Jonglei State, where fighting in August killed around 600 people and displaced over 20,000, the UN estimates.\n\"The people at \u2018severe risk\u2019 may either not have enough food to eat, enough money to buy seed to plant or enough money to buy food. The prices are increasing almost every hour. I am in Wau, Western Bahr el Ghazal, nobody can get food at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning because people queue up at the restaurant and other local hotels for food\u201d, the minister added.\nIn many parts of the Republic of South Sudan, he said, food prices have gone up due drought and the closure of supply routes with north Sudan after partition. The situation is especially bad in the areas closest to the border with Sudan.\nAn agreement between North and South Sudan to create ten points for trade and for people to move between the two countries has yet to be implemented.\nMinister Acuil said his government was working with donors to invest in irrigation systems to increase crop production.\n\"Urgent action is needed to prevent a looming humanitarian and food crisis in this country\", said Acuil.\nHe added that more than 11,000 people returning to South Sudan are in Renk awaiting transportation, explaining that local resources have been overstretched.\nIn order to address the food shortages the United Nations World Programme (WFP) is helping South Sudan\u2019s government by constructing new roads to improve humanitarian access and allow agriculture goods to be brought to market.\nLakes state Governor Chol Tong Mayay, speaking at the inauguration of two roads being built in Rumbek East County, pledged unconditional support and cooperation of his administration to facilitate humanitarian operations in the area.\nThe two new roads link local farmers to markets marking the beginning of a three-year partnership between the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the South Sudan Ministry of Transport to build a total of 500 kilometres of feeder roads to help boost agriculture development.\nThe two roads, totaling 114 km, will connect the villages of Karich with Amok Piny and Aluakluak with Akuoc Cok, providing farmers with better access to markets. The project is being carried out in close cooperation with the Ministry for Roads and Bridges and local government authorities.\n\u201cWe are proud to be starting the construction of this road, which will connect food producers to markets and will connect isolated communities,\u201d said Mayay, in a statement sent to Sudan Tribune.\nSpeaking to Sudan Tribune on Wednesday in Juba, Lydia Stone, a senior WFP staff member explained that road construction is a key part of WFP\u2019s support to South Sudan to enable the nascent country to overcome some of the obstacles to developing agriculture.\n\u201cFeeder roads link areas with high agricultural potential to trunk roads and will provide farmers with easier access to markets for their crops, thereby stimulating production and trade\u201d, she said.\nIn the statement Kuoi Maluach, the chief of Paloich, one of the remote villages connected by the new road said: \u201cWe suffer from insecurity and a lack of services. If a woman is having trouble giving birth, we have to transport her to the clinic by bicycle. The road will change everything. It will give us access to trade and services\u201d.\nStone said Chris Nikoi, WFP\u2019s new country director, plans to build 500 km of feeder roads throughout South Sudan, especially in areas with high food production.\nShe named Western Equatoria as one of the states WFP plans to help the government construct feeder roads to facilitate local farmers access markets with their produce.\nThe two roads in Rumbek East are being built with funding from the South Sudan Recovery Fund. WFP has contracted the German organization GIZ to undertake the construction works which will be completed by July 2012. To ensure the long life of the feeder roads, local authorities and communities are being trained in road maintenance. Since 2004, WFP has repaired 2,600 km of trunk road, linking eight out of the ten state capitals and connecting South Sudan to Uganda and Kenya via four different routes.\nThe two feeder roads are being constructed as part of the Lakes State Stabilisation Programme, a joint UN programme under the ownership of the government of South Sudan. The programme aims to show the benefits of peace and encourage the participation and empowerment of communities affected by conflict and poverty.\nCustomers in Unity state have told Sudan Tribune reporter Bonifacio Taban Kuich that the cost of some basic food products have doubled since South Sudan became independent in July.\nTraders and retailers say that they are not to blame for the increase in prices of food and other goods due to the long distances they have to travel and the increase in fuel prices. Landlocked South Sudan has to import almost all of its food and other goods including petrol.\nDespite being an oil producing country South Sudan has no refinery or processing plant so it has to send its oil to be exported through North Sudan. Juba accuses Khartoum of the blocking the world\u2019s newest international border forcing price rises especially in border states like Unity. In September the two countries agreed to establish ten entry check points in order to facilitate the movement for goods and people.\nAfter South Sudan\u2019s secession many traders from North Sudan returned to the North leaving locals to step in to fill the gap. Women in Rubkotna town have taken over businesses from Darfuri traders including vegetable sales.\nOne of the women, Nyayang Nhial, said a bundle of ground okra that cost 1 South Sudanese Pound (SSP) two months ago now costs 2 SSP.\n\"Before the local perfumes cost 20 SSP but now reached up to 50 SSP\", said Nhial who started working in 2005 after her husband died in a car accident.\nCustomers told Sudan Tribune that almost everything in the market had doubled in price.\nViviana Philip, a customer at the market said she cannot afford to feed her family properly. Items like slippers have risen from 10 SSP to 25 SSP over the last two months, she said while asking the government to intervene.\nLocal butcher Latjor Wiyoak said that meat prices have also increased from 10 SSP to 12 SSP a kilo. He said traders had been forced into the price hike as otherwise they would make a loss.\nBusinesses in South Sudan face many challenges. Poor roads and insecurity make it difficult to move goods around the county and river transport can take weeks.\nAs most traders in South Sudan were from the North before independence many South Sudanese are not as experienced at importing goods from abroad which inevitably involves using much sort-after hard currency.\nPresident Salva Kiir of South Sudan announced this week that he would hold a meeting with his northern counterpart Omar Hassan al-Bashir on the issue of price rises and rampant inflation.\nStops issuing these stark warnings and get down to the real business of picking it so urgently. It\u2019s too dires now, and will eventually be too diaboblical if you guys failed to addressed it cause now rather later.\nThis is a man-made drought so, the government of South Sudan should take the case to the International Court at Hague against the Global Pollutors Europe, USA, Russia, China, India and Australia. Although there are others, these mentioned countries are the major Pollutors and must be held accountable for loss of Rain in Africa.\nthe should start doing something before this particular cost of living shooting high and rocket the sky. it is the government responsibility to address the food prices before it is deteriorate. failure to address it will lead into disaster.\nSurprise! Our government did not see this coming! Instead of making food security the number one priority, guess what did it do, it made the relocation of the capital city an important matter. What a bunch of mindless people!\nI fully agree with the statement attibuted to the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs about the looming famine in South Sudan if urgent intervention measures were not taken. The issue had already been raised. What I do not seem to understand is Minister\u2019s claim that \" greater Equatoria region had been the worst effected by the late rains this year\" is not in accord with the facts. Plse crosscheck.\nThe recent Rapid Cros Assessment (RCA) indicates that the only states which were better off in terms of food secuirty were the three states in Greater Equatoria. The Minister therefore has to crosscheck his information so that any intervention has to address the trully food insecure population.",

    "text": "No, Trump can\u2019t pardon himself. The Constitution tells us so.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed misspelled the name of former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger. This version has been updated.\nLaurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007 and is vice-chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and is chair of CREW.\nCan a president pardon himself? Four days before Richard Nixon resigned, his own Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined no, citing \u201cthe fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d We agree.\nThe Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law.\nThe Constitution specifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal. It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution. That provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\nThe pardon provision of the Constitution is there to enable the president to act essentially in the role of a judge of another person\u2019s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable. For example, the president might believe the courts made the wrong decision about someone\u2019s guilt or about sentencing; President Barack Obama felt this way about excessive sentences for low-level drug offenses. Or the president might be impressed by the defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct and, using powers far exceeding those of a parole board, might issue a pardon or commutation of sentence.\nOther equitable considerations could also weigh in favor of leniency. A president might choose to grant a pardon before prosecution of a person when the president believes that the prosecution is not in the national interest; President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon in part for this reason.\nOr a president may conclude that even if a person may have committed a crime, he was acting in good faith to protect the national interest; President George H.W. Bush pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra affair in part for this reason.\nIn all such instances, however, the president is acting as a kind of super-judge and making a decision about someone else\u2019s conduct, the justice of someone else\u2019s sentence or whether it is in the national interest to prosecute someone else. He is not making a decision about himself.\nThe Constitution embodies this broad precept against self-dealing in its rule that congressional pay increases cannot take effect during the Congress that enacted them, in its prohibition against using official power to gain favors from foreign states and even in its provision that the chief justice, not the vice president, is to preside when the Senate conducts an impeachment trial of the president.\nThe Constitution\u2019s pardon clause has its origins in the royal pardon granted by a sovereign to one of his or her subjects. We are aware of no precedent for a sovereign pardoning himself, then abdicating or being deposed but being immune from criminal process. If that were the rule, many a deposed king would have been spared instead of going to the chopping block.\nWe know of not a single instance of a self-pardon having been recognized as legitimate. Even the pope does not pardon himself. On March 28, 2014, in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Pope Francis publicly kneeled before a priest and confessed his sins for about three minutes.\nPresident Trump thinks he can do a lot of things just because he is president. He says that the president can act as if he has no conflicts of interest. He says that he can fire the FBI director for any reason he wants (and he admitted to the most outrageous of reasons in interviews and in discussion with the Russian ambassador). In one sense, Trump is right \u2014 he can do all of these things, although there will be legal repercussions if he does. Using official powers for corrupt purposes \u2014 such as impeding or obstructing an investigation \u2014 can constitute a crime.\nBut there is one thing we know that Trump cannot do \u2014 without being a first in all of human history. He cannot pardon himself.\nElizabeth Holtzman: In the Russia probe, could Trump pardon himself?\nDana Milbank: Trump can do whatever he wants. God help us.",

    "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A few weeks ago, we ran a provocative piece by Stephen Watts and Sean Mann in which they argued that in both its politics and in its development, Afghanistan is doing better than is commonly believed. Gary Owen, a civilian development worker who has spent the last several years working on the ground in Afghanistan, begs to differ. He paints a far gloomier picture of Afghanistan, arguing that the country and U.S. policy have a long way to go.\nMany Americans are surprisingly bullish on Afghanistan, and this perspective showed up in a July Lawfare post on \u201cAfghanistan After the Drawdown\u201d by RAND analysts Stephen Watts and Sean Mann. Although the two authors offer some valid points, they miss many of the country\u2019s problems and, in so doing, are wrongly optimistic about where Afghanistan is going.\nAfter a decade and more of U.S. intervention, it can be difficult to pin down how things are going in Afghanistan. By some measures, things in Afghanistan are better: There are more children in school than there were under the Taliban, more Afghans have access to basic healthcare than before the 2001 invasion, and Internet access means more connections to the outside world than was ever possible during the time of the black turbans. Watts and Mann cite those cases as reasons to be optimistic about the country, and rightly so. Where they go wrong is in three key areas: relations with Pakistan, the current government as a symbol of Afghan unity, and the abilities of Afghan security forces.\nPakistan\u2019s got plenty to worry about when it comes to sanctuaries within its own borders, a grim point made by last year\u2019s school shooting in Peshawar. And recent revelations that Mullah Omar died in Pakistan, and his whereabouts were known to the ISI for years, don\u2019t paint a picture of Afghanistan being used as a base to launch operations against Pakistan. Instead it speaks to Pakistan\u2019s harboring of the Taliban with the government\u2019s knowledge, something Islamabad is scrambling to correct as they look ahead to peace talks with the Taliban.\nOr it\u2019s just a case of Afghanistan following the American lead.\nIn the fall of 2014, after another runoff election threatened to bring the country\u2019s democratic future to a grinding halt, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed a group made up of Abdullah\u2019s leadership team. According to an administration official, Kerry told the group, \u201cI have to emphasize to you that if you do not have an agreement, if you do not move to a unity government, the United States will not be able to support Afghanistan.\u201d Aimed squarely at those who supported Abdullah to the point that they might take up arms in his name, Kerry\u2019s statement was an offer neither Ghani nor Abdullah could possibly refuse. The current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThe current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThanks to advances by the Taliban in Faryab and Kunduz, influential politicians like Rashid Dostum (currently Ghani\u2019s vice president) and Atta Noor (the powerful governor of Balkh province) have been pretty vocal in their thinking that Afghan forces alone can\u2019t get the job done; that to tip the balance means more troops from somewhere\u2014either the Americans (not out of the question completely, but unlikely), or some kind of militia. Since today\u2019s anti-Taliban militia could be tomorrow\u2019s coup attempt, it lays some troubling groundwork for widening existing divides in the country that the United States had hoped the Ghani/Abdullah deal would help bridge. Unless they can manage to bring the security situation that\u2019s deteriorating faster than Iggy Azalea\u2019s career back under control, Afghan troops could have some new bosses very soon. Their current performance doesn\u2019t inspire much hope.\nActually, it\u2019s pretty clear how those forces will perform. In a word? Badly.\nSince the Afghans assumed control of the country\u2019s security in 2014, more civilians have been killed, more soldiers have died, more Afghan troops have deserted than ever before, and security forces are still torturing one-third of their detainees. This is the force Watts and Mann describe as \u201cpassably capable\u201d and \u201cresilient.\u201d If by \u201cpassably capable\u201d they mean \u201cdoesn\u2019t torture too many people,\u201d then sure, I suppose they are \u201cpassably capable,\u201d but I think we might want to aim just a bit higher.\nAccording to the Americans, civilian casualties as a result of ground engagements between the Afghans and insurgents were up eight percent for the first three months of 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. In June, Afghan Chief of Army Staff Gen. Qadam Shah Shaheem told his troops that using artillery and conducting night raids against the insurgents was just fine, and no one would be prosecuted as a result. Since most engagements occur among the population when one is countering an insurgency, this change in the rules of engagement means more innocent civilians are going to die as the result of actions by Afghan security forces. That\u2019s borne out by the latest report on civilian casualties from UNAMA, which found that throughout the first half of 2015, Afghan forces caused more civilian casualties than the Taliban did.\nAnd when they\u2019re not busy leveling villages, Afghan forces are dying in record numbers. Throughout the first five months of 2015, security forces casualties were up 70 percent from the same period in 2014. Some of that\u2019s attributable to increasing activity by the insurgents, but a \u201ccapable\u201d force doesn\u2019t see that kind of casualty increase unless its capabilities are less than optimal. Even so, the biggest cause of attrition for Afghan troops isn\u2019t being killed in action (KIA). According to a June report by the Americans to Congress, the largest source for attrition is \u201cdropped from rolls\u201d (wherein a soldier stops showing up for work for more than a month so he\u2019s no longer counted), and KIA is the smallest source for Afghan force attrition.\nBut when they do manage to not die and to show up for work, Afghan forces like to spend some quality time with their detainees. A February report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) found that while torture is on the decrease, around 35 percent of all detainees surveyed reported being tortured in detention. Much of that alleged torture was at the hands of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which is similar to the FBI, except that the FBI has better windbreakers and isn\u2019t prone to hooking people up to car batteries unnecessarily. That probably explains why the Americans made it clear in June that no U.S. funds were going to the NDS, even though nearly every other aspect of Afghan defense operations comes directly from American coffers and internal defense is vital for the success of the counterinsurgency.\nIn an alternate-reality Afghanistan, civilians aren\u2019t dying in greater numbers, the government isn\u2019t on the verge of collapse, and the return on foreign investment is staggering.

There is cause for cautious optimism. That does not mean that we shouldn\u2019t be painfully honest about what\u2019s happening in Afghanistan. Given the sacrifices made since 9/11, it\u2019s tempting to do otherwise. But doing so means ignoring challenges the country faces, and the decisions about its future the Americans still need to make.",

    "text": "University of Utah track and field athlete Lauren McCluskey was found shot dead Monday night in the backseat of a vehicle outside a campus dormitory, according to university police. The suspected shooter was 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, a man McCluskey\u2019s family said she had recently stopped dating. Rowland\u2019s body was found a few hours later at a church; police said he died by suicide.\nAt a press conference, university police chief Dale Brophy said that McCluskey had filed a police report with them \u201con Oct. 12 and Oct. 13\u201d about threats from Rowland. There was \u201csome follow-up\u201d and it was assigned to a detective who was \u201cworking to build a case against our suspect at that time,\u201d Brophy said. The police chief would not go into further details about what happened with that investigation.\nOn Monday night, Brophy said that police got a call from a frantic mother saying \u201csomething happened to her daughter.\u201d In a statement released by the McCluskey family, McCluskey\u2019s mother said that she was on the phone with her daughter that night when she suddenly heard Lauren McCluskey yell \u201cno no no!\u201d Afraid her daughter was in a car accident, she stayed on the line while her husband called 911. A few minutes later, the family statement said, \u201ca young woman picked up the phone and said all of Lauren\u2019s things were on the ground.\u201d It was the last time she spoke with her daughter.\nPolice officers went to the parking lot and found McCluskey\u2019s body, Brophy said. The university issued an alert and an order for students to \u201csecure-in-place.\u201d It was lifted at 11:46 p.m., according to the university\u2019s website, after police determined that Rowland was no longer on campus. Brophy said that Rowland was picked up by a vehicle and, about 1:15 a.m. he was spotted by Salt Lake City police who ran after him. Rowland got inside the Trinity AME Church, where he killed himself. A retired pastor told the Salt Lake Tribune that, to the best of his knowledge, Rowland didn\u2019t attend the church and he had no idea why he chose that building.\nThe family of McCluskey, 21, said that their daughter had dated Rowland for about a month. She ended the relationship after she learned about his criminal history.\nLauren was a senior student athlete on the University of Utah track team. She was an outstanding student with a 3.75 GPA majoring in Communication and was excited to graduate in May 2019. She was a 2015 honors graduate of Pullman High School where she was Washington state champion in the high jump and the school record holder in the 100 meter hurdles. She attended Capital Church in Salt Lake City. She loved to sing and had strength and determination. She was dearly loved and will be greatly missed.\nPolice said the two had been in a \u201cprior relationship,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t comment further. According to Utah Department of Corrections, Rowland was convicted in 2004 of enticing a minor, a second-degree felony, and attempted forcible sexual abuse, a third-degree felony. His last known home, Brophy said, was a halfway house.",
    "wm_text": " Rowland was released from prison in August 2018, according to Utah Department of Corrections. He was also recently transferred to the state\u2019s medium custody level, where he was serving a sentence for being a convicted criminal in possession of a dangerous weapon.\nRowland was scheduled to appear in court October 15 regarding another charge, failure to appear. He was being held at the Salt Lake County Jail.\nRowland was wearing a disguise, police said, when he went to McCluskey\u2019s on-campus residence hall. He walked into a stairwell, where he fired at least one gun and shot her. He tried to flee, but campus police officers followed and placed him in custody without injury. No one else in the dorm was hurt. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how Rowland managed to get into the residence hall. The university said that the residence halls, as well as the library and a student union, were placed on lockdown Monday night and Tuesday. The university also activated its text and email alert system to keep students and faculty up to date.\nRowland was not an athlete at the university, said spokesman Chris Nelson. He said that Rowland was not formally enrolled in school but may have been in his second year in an online program. The university said that Rowland didn\u2019t have a car on-campus, which would explain how he was able to drive the car to her dorm. He didn\u2019t possess a firearm on-campus, said Nelson. However, because the school has a policy that allows people on campus with concealed firearms permits, Rowland was likely legally able to carry one.",

It seems government goes after anybody who is capable of mounting an intellectual and practical challenge to the them. The government has become so authoritarian recently that it doesn't allow any opposition activism at all, whether it is Jamaat or any other party.\"\nThe Supreme Court's decision to reject Ali's appeal was a major blow for the Jamaat-e-Islami party, which the 63-year-old tycoon had helped to revive in recent decades.\nFive opposition leaders have been executed for war crimes since 2013. Ali was the last prominent leader of Jamaat to face execution.\nThe war crimes tribunal set up by the government has divided the country, with supporters of Jamaat and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party branding it a sham aimed at eliminating their leaders.\nAli was convicted in November 2014 of a series of crimes during Bangladesh's war of separation from Pakistan, including the abduction and murder of a young independence fighter.\nHis son, Mir Ahmed Bin Quasem, who was part of his legal defence team, was allegedly abducted by security forces earlier in August, which critics say was an attempt to sow fear and prevent protests against the execution.",

    "text": "CINCINNATI -- As FC Cincinnati fans chanted and cheered for taxpayers to help fund a Major League Soccer stadium, Hamilton County leaders laid out a bleak reality: The county has too many projects and no way to pay for them all.\nFrom an outdated convention center to the obsolete Western Hills Viaduct, Hamilton County Commissioners are trying to figure out how to pay for more than $1.5 billion worth of infrastructure, development, transportation and county building needs in the coming years.\n\"We have more projects than we have money,\" Hamilton County Commission President Todd Portune told a crowd of at least 150 people Tuesday night.\nAnd a battle over one of the few sources of money left -- a small slice of sales tax that becomes available in 2020, currently being used to pay for a renovation of Union Terminal -- is already brewing.\nPortune called the meeting Tuesday to gather public comments to help decide which projects the county should fund.\nFC Cincinnati's General Manager Jeff Berding led roughly 100 of the team's fans into the packed meeting, yelling \"Build it here.\" It's no surprise that Berding, a former Cincinnati city councilman, was able to organize the loudest and largest display of political pressure in the room.\nMore than 30 people weighed in on a range of projects, but most begged commissioners to help post the $100 million FC Cincinnati is requesting from taxpayers to build a $200 million MLS stadium in Cincinnati. The team is currently contending for a spot in the MLS, and Berding said he needs a stadium deal hammered out before the end of the year.\n\"We're not here to ask that you only support FC Cincinnati because we have many needs in this community,\" Berding told the three-member commission. \"But we're probably asking to be among the first, given the timeline of the decision.\"\nFC Cincinnati's ask to be first in line is still a big deal.\nThe county is grappling with an overcrowded jail, a dated courthouse and an aging Jobs and Family Services building -- all of which serve hundreds of county families. In 10 years, the county will be grappling with a $266 million maintenance backlog, Hamilton County Administrator Jeff Aluotto said.\nThe city's two current major league sports teams -- the Reds and the Bengals -- will eventually come knocking on the county's door for a new deal. The Bengals stadium lease with the county expires in 2026, and the Reds' lease expires a few years after. Combined, the two stadiums could need more than $200 million in upgrades within the next decade.\n\"While no one is talking about demoing these stadiums, we know there will be substantial maintenance (needs),\" Alutto said.\nCounty taxpayers will need to help pay for some of the $330 million overhaul of the Western Hills Viaduct. Hamilton County Engineer Ted Hubbard has proposed paying for some of that project with an additional $5 driver's license fee.\n\"It needs to be addressed and now,\" Portune said Tuesday.\nA $230 million upgrade of the Duke Energy Convention center is necessary to keep visitors -- and their money -- flowing into the city, experts say. Another $10 million renovation of Sharonville Convention Center is also needed, Sharonville's mayor said Tuesday.\nU.S. Bank Arena owners have asked the Port Authority to buy the deteriorating facility and for taxpayers to finance a $342 million demolition and rebuild it. The building's small and old conditions have caused the city to miss out on huge conventions, most notably the Republican National Convention last year, that would have pumped millions of dollars into the city's economy.\n\"It allows Cincinnati and the county to compete,\" said Nederlander Entertainment COO Ray Harris. \"We're willing to work with anybody to try and make Cincinnati better.\nThe Banks, which taxpayers have already invested $135 million to carve out on Ohio's river , remains unfinished.\nMeanwhile, any money that would be used to pay for these projects is nearly tapped out.\nCounty is painting a bleak picture here for available $. Hotel tax - tapped. Sales tax - a quarter left. None = new stadium or arena.\nThe county can't collect any more hotel tax. Parking revenues generated from garages at The Banks are being used to pay down the debt on those garages. And the county can only legally collect a quarter percent more in sales tax, which would mean buyers pay 7.25 percent on every purchase, bringing in roughly $38 million every year. Hamilton County currently charges a 7 percent sales tax.\nThat little room to fund even one or two of the projects discussed Tuesday.\n\"There is not now, and never will be, enough money to ever fund every major capital project that is before you for consideration,\" said Tim Mara, a Cincinnati attorney and government watchdog who led the charge against a tax increase to pay for Paul Brown Stadium and Great American Ball Park more than 20 years ago.\nMara was one of a few speakers who urged commissioners to oppose any taxpayer funding for a new FC Cincinnati stadium.\n\"It makes no sense to divert scarce money to building a soccer stadium when these vital needs remain unfunded,\" he said.\nCommissioners are bracing for a fight over the quarter percent sales tax increase, currently used to pay for a restoration of Union Terminal, that expires in 2020. That sales tax generates roughly $38 million every year. It's been floated as a way to pay for the Western Hills Viaduct, the FC Cincinnati Stadium and, now, U.S. Bank Arena.\nIn a statement released just moments after Tuesday's meeting ended, U.S. Bank Arena leaders called for the county to use that sales tax money for a $342 million overhaul of the 42-year-old facility. That plan would require a seven-year extension of the sales tax.\nBut the clock is ticking for the county to strike a deal that would keep FC Cincinnati on the Ohio side of the river, dozens of soccer fans draped in orange and blue reminded the commissioners Tuesday night.\n\"We have time to do the other projects later, this one needs to take precedent,\" FC Cincinnati Max Ellerbe said.",

We don't know what the family was doing in France but it looks like they were on holiday because their car was packed with luggage,\" he said.\nIn an interview with the France3 TV channel, a member of the emergency services said two of the children were dead when they arrived and the father was trapped.\nTwo air amublances were called to ferry the injured mother and surviving son to hospital and police closed off the motorway for several hours.\nThe scene was so devastating that a psychologist was brought in to counsel the two dozen rescue workers who worked at the crash site.\nIn Hartlepool, one neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: \"John was a big lad, he was only young.

Mitch McConnell can rectify this immediately,\" Stewart said, noting that the Kentucky pol sponsored a health care bill for nuclear energy workers that has cost $11 billion.\n\"How in good conscience can you deny them the very thing that you have proudly brought to the people of your state? Please, personally ask him that,\" Stewart said.\nMcConnell ignored questions about his role in blocking the legislation after a press conference Tuesday. His spokesman denied he was the roadblock.\nSept. 11 advocate John Feal said the group met with McConnell Wednesday and he promised to include Zadroga in an omnibus budget bill, but said money must still be found to pay for it.\nCongress let the World Trade Center Health Program expire in September. The program has enough money to continue treatment for responders suffering from cancer and respiratory disease caused by Ground Zero toxins for now, but it will run out if the feds don't renew it.\nBackers want a permanent reauthorization.\n\"Men and women who answered the call of duty after the gravest terrorist attack in our nation's history stood there on the pile looking for survivors, finding remains, doing the horrible work of cleaning up after such a loss \u2014 all the while breathing in so many deadly toxins that are now killing them,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).\n\"They came because they are patriots. They came before they are heroes. So what is Congress doing today? Nothing. The answer is nothing.\"\nStill, she vowed to get the bill over the finish line before Congress leaves town for the holidays.\n\"We are moving this bill,\" she said. \"What we need from our Senate and House leadership is exactly that \u2014 leadership.\"",

Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. From out of the past come the thundering hoof beats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!\"\nHow many times I must have heard those lines, and how impressive they must have been, to be remembered 70 years later?\nmeans stupid in Spanish? What did kemo sabe mean? \u2013 boss, or pal, or champion of justice, or paleface idiot?\nWhen I was little, there was no radio in our house; our parents were deaf. Our grandparents had a big table-model Philco in their parlor. Just as kids nowadays tease for an iPhone, I kept asking for a radio until I got it. A tiny, dark-brown Bakelite-cased Arvin, it sat on the sideboard in our dining room.\nEvery weekday, from 4:45 till 6:00 in the afternoon, I pulled my long-legged chair up to the sideboard, turned on the radio, and gazed at the dial. Many of you must remember \"watching the radio\" and memorizing the numbers of the AM dial, from 520 to 1610 kilohertz. I could tell from the glances I got from my parents as I sat there \u2013 sitting still for longer than at any other time in my life \u2013 that they suspected I was listening to something inappropriate and possibly sinful.\nAt 4:45 a voice crackled over a simulated radio transmission: \"CX4 to control tower. CX4 to control tower. Standing by\u2026\" The answer was immediate: \"Control tower to CX4. Wind southeast, ceiling 1200. All clear.\"\n\"This is Hop Harrigan, coming in!\" So it went: five 15-minute episodes, featuring Jack Armstrong, Captain Midnight; Terry and the Pirates, and finally Tom Mix.\nEvenings, there were half-hour shows \u2013 The Green Hornet; The Shadow, in real life Lamont Cranston, \"wealthy young man-about-town\" who once in the Orient had learned to \"cloud men\u2019s minds so they cannot see him.\"\nEverything we imagined was the product of our separate minds\u2019 eyes. When the Lone Ranger walked across the board platform of a railroad station, each of us constructed a different scene. It was like the famous \"driveway moments\" on Public Radio; you could do nothing else demanding thought while you were into an on-air drama. Listening to archived recordings now reveals it to have been pretty simplistic drivel. Still, wasn\u2019t it glorious!\n(TAG) You can find more commentaries by Willem Lange at VPR-dot-net.",

    "text": "Upbeat on plans: Girija Pande of TCS says the company\u2019s revenues from its Chinese operations will grow by around 45% in the next two years.\nHyderabad: With business from the US and Europe expected to decrease due to the ongoing financial turmoil, Indian information technology services (IT) firms are increasing their focus on the Asia Pacific region, particularly China, in an effort to tap the latter\u2019s IT market and use it as a strategic base to enter the at least $100 billion (Rs4.76 trillion)-a-year Japanese IT market.\nBusiness from the US and Europe together account for between 80% and 95% of revenues of the top five Indian IT services firms, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd or TCS, Infosys Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd, Satyam Computer Services Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd.\nMarket research firm IDC estimates the Chinese IT services market to reach at least $55 billion by 2010.\nTCS entered China in 2002 with a software development and delivery center. While its initial objective was to serve its global clients having Chinese operations, the company has now started addressing the regional and local market. Currently, it has 1,300 employees working in China. In its latest annual report, TCS said its China operations had managed to break even.\nAccording to Girija Pande, executive vice-president and head of Asia Pacific division at TCS, the Chinese IT market is growing by at least 20% annually and revenue from the company\u2019s Chinese operations will grow by around 45% in the next two years.\n\u201cIn the short term, we will be expanding our presence and increasing the headcount to at least 5,000 by 2011,\" said Pande.\nSimilarly, Infosys has a 1,000-strong workforce in China and said it is in expansion mode. \u201cWe have expanded our operations in two cities Shanghai and Hangzhou,\" a company spokesperson said in an email response. The company\u2019s Chinese subsidiaries, however, were still loss-making as on 30 September, according to the company\u2019s second quarter results.\nSatyam admitted it is yet to make significant headway with its China operations but said it is in expansion mode with an eye on the long-term.\nThe company currently employs around 1,000 people in its two subsidiaries in China and plans to scale up headcount to nearly 2,000 by 2010. It is also investing in a training centre in China, which will have a capacity of at least 2,500 by 2010.\n\u201cIt is still a mystery why Indian companies have not been able to get any significant share of outsourced work from China and Japan,\" said Virender Aggarwal, head of rest of the world operations for Satyam.\nAnalysts acknowledge that China has been a rather difficult market for a variety of reasons.\n\u201cSo far, the Chinese domestic market has been one that is difficult to engage, primarily because of state and public sector dominance,\" said Milan Sheth, partner and head of IT outsourcing advisory at audit and consulting firm Ernst and Young. \u201cIt is critical to have a well connected and established Chinese local partner who can help penetrate that market,\" he said.\nTCS said it views China as a better base to address the Japanese market. \u201cA significant share of outsourced work from the Japanese market is cornered by Chinese companies, as they have a relative cultural and linguistic advantage over their Indian counterparts. We see being present in China as the first step in building the right relationships,\" said Pande.\nBoth TCS and Satyam are betting on local talent to succeed in their Chinese operations and help the company better address the local market as well as help build bridges with Japanese companies. At least 90% of TCS\u2019 workforce in China comprises local hires.\nNasscom\u2019s Som Mittal said that the size of the Japanese IT market and the potential for outsourcing presents a huge opportunity for Indian IT firms, but, he added that the market has been relatively insulated due to language and cultural barriers. \u201cHowever, we see an increasing desire among Japanese companies for sourcing competitively priced IT services from foreign companies. More importantly, the factors limiting market penetration by Indian companies are being recognized and addressed by the Japanese themselves.\"\nNasscom has set up a Japan desk to explore ways for Indian IT companies to adapt themselves to compete more effectively in the Japanese market.\nBoth China and Japan are long-term plays, said experts.\n\u201cIt is very important for Indian IT companies to understand that investments in the Chinese market should be done with a long term view. Given the nature of that market, it is unrealistic to expect quick turnarounds,\" Sheth said.\nWipro and HCL did not respond to queries on their China and Japan strategy.",

    "text": "After much anticipation, Melania Trump has finally given the world a glimpse of her platform.\nLike those before her, Trump is keen to make a difference in her own unique way. Speaking in the Rose Garden, she officially launched \"Be Best,\" which tackles three key pillars: well-being, social media and opioid abuse.\nBut what does it take to be effective as first lady, especially amid an ever moving spectrum of expectations, responsibility and public opinion?\nThe first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, recently stated that most first ladies have focused on a single issue. In fact, several presidential spouses in the last century have taken on multiple causes, and Trump can look to them for guidance. To be successful, here are three recommendations from the Bush Institute's report \"A Role Without a Rulebook\" that Trump should consider implementing.\n1. Develop a strategic vision.\nAs first lady, Trump is uniquely positioned to be a compassionate listener and supportive facilitator. As she develops this platform, she should clearly define actionable goals that engage citizens at local and national levels.\nShe can look to her peer, Laura Bush, who launched \"Ready to Read, Ready to Learn\" with two clear objectives in mind: to ensure young children are prepared when they enter their first classroom, and once there have well-trained, qualified teachers. She also addressed how these goals would be achieved. By outlining a clear mission alongside defined actions, Bush was able to make progress on these goals during her time as first lady.\n2. Engage with citizens and peers.\nIn a polarized political climate, Trump must embrace the opportunity to transcend boundaries. Unelected but official, she is able to build bridges between government and civil society. For example, one of our most prominent first ladies, Eleanor Roosevelt, championed causes including racial equality, labor rights and women's rights, and she was the first presidential spouse to testify before a congressional committee. Central to her efforts: community and stakeholder outreach.\nEngagement with predecessors and peers can also aid Trump's efforts. For example, longstanding advocates for mental health and those battling addictive diseases, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford joined forces to advance policy and increase support for services. Reflecting on their collaboration, Carter said: \"(Betty and I) could be a stronger force if we worked as partners, and we did for many years.\"\nTrump has the opportunity to use the power of partnership. As political influences, first ladies can reach across industries and ideologies to unite diverse viewpoints and mobilize action. For example, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden launched \"Joining Forces,\" working with the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for service members, veterans and their families by providing the tools needed to succeed throughout their lives.\nWhile the role of first lady is one without a rulebook, these are proven actions that can aid Trump's efforts on a variety of platforms. When used effectively, a first lady's podium serves as a force for change.\nNatalie Gonnella-Platts is the deputy director of the Women's Initiative at the George W. Bush Institute and co-author of \"A Role Without a Rulebook: The Influence and Leadership of Global First Ladies.\" She wrote this for InsideSources.com.",

The Israelis came from the rocket-battered town of Sderot, and the Palestinians from Hebron, near to where earlier this summer Hamas terrorists abducted and executed three Jewish teens.\nThe game marked the start of the current year of the \u201cSchool of Football and Peace,\u201d a campaign by the Peres Center for Peace that brings together dozens of Israeli and Palestinian children for sports and other extracurricular learning activities.\nIsrael\u2019s \u201cpeace partners\u201d in the Palestinian Authority, however, didn\u2019t seem to feel the same.\n\u201cAny activity of normalization in sports with the Zionist enemy is a crime against humanity,\u201d insisted Jibril Rajoub, a senior member of the ruling Fatah faction and head of the Palestinian Supreme Council for Sports and Youth Affairs.\nIn a post to his Facebook page (which was translated by Palestinian Media Watch), Rajoub said it was official policy to oppose and prevent joint sporting events between Israeli and Palestinian children.\nA local Fatah spokesman vowed that the party would \u201csettle the account with these reckless people,\u201d meaning the coach and other organizers who had dared to let Palestinian children commit the heinous crime of playing soccer with Israeli Jews.",

The West Bank team, Misr Football Club, plays at a field in Yatta, which is just across the Green Line dividing Israel from the West Bank. The field is located near the Palestinian village of Yatta.\nThere was even less sense in canceling the game at that point. The Israeli soccer kids who had been practicing with those from the West Bank had been traveling from Sderot to the West Bank every Thursday for the past month to play games, only for this week\u2019s trip to be abruptly canceled.\nNot by a small margin either. The Israeli soccer kids who had been traveling from Sderot to the West Bank every Thursday for the past month were suddenly all stranded in Israel.\nSome of the Israeli kids, who are in the first grade, had been counting down the days until they could get to their next \u201clunchtime\u201d match with their West Bank counterparts.\nOne Israeli kid\u2019s mother told The Jerusalem Post the kids had been counting the hours until they could get to their next \u201clunchtime\u201d match with their West Bank counterparts. She said she had to send a note to their classroom explaining they would not be going to school on Thursday.\nPerhaps in the West Bank soccer kids\u2019 eyes, playing a friendly match with Israeli kids was not worth the risk of having to explain to their classmates and the institution of Palestinian law that they had broken the body-slamming, head-slicing, sport-throwing policy that the Palestinian leadership has enunciated so",

Pascua- Lama is also a \u201creally big overhang\u201d for Barrick, he said.\nGold futures in New York yesterday dropped below $1,200 for the first time since August 2010, as signs of improving U.S. economic growth boosted speculation the Federal Reserve will wind down its asset-purchase program. After rising to a record $1,923.70 an ounce in September 2011, gold futures for August delivery fell 1.6 percent to $1,192.20 at 8:47 a.m. today on the Comex in New York.\nBarrick has forecast it will cost $950 to $1,050 to produce an ounce of gold on average from all its mines this year. Goldcorp forecast a cost of $1,000 to $1,100.",

China\u2019s nickel makers, which have stored the metal in warehouses for more than a year, are now selling almost all the metal to foreign customers ahead of full refining to meet stricter environmental controls.\nNickel miners are being punished for \u201creserves stuck on the ground\u201d and for \u201ccash-burning operations,\u201d said Ivan Drury, a Toronto-based metals analyst at Fitch Ratings. He\u2019s predicting more cuts in nickel production and mine cash costs this year after nickel prices sank to their lowest in 13 years last year. The London Metal Exchange nickel price dropped 57 percent from the 2011 peak to end the first half of this year at $13,880 a metric ton.\n\u201cThe nickel market\u2019s really suffering right now,\u201d said Amy Leiken, an analyst at IG Markets Ltd. in Melbourne, Australia.\nLloyd\u2019s List reported yesterday that the first half of this year was the first in five years in which the cash costs of Cairn Energy Plc and Neptune Energy Plc, the two biggest U.K.-listed oil explorers, fell below their crude oil output costs. The companies produced an average of 1.6 million barrels a day in the first half, well below their cash costs, which came in at $53 a barrel.\nOil\nOil prices have tumbled almost 50 percent since June to end the first half of this year at $77.46 a barrel, or $3.65 a gallon, partly due to rising shale production in the U.S. the biggest producer of oil in the world. Oil demand in China, which had been rising at a double-digit pace, has stopped growing, according to UBS AG.\n",

    "text": "The FINANCIAL (AD) -- ProCredit Bank has donated a unique ex libris collection to the National Centre of Manuscripts. This donation was part of a project jointly initiated by the National Centre of Manuscripts and ProCredit Bank, in which the Bank bought a unique collection of ex librises from a private individual living in Thessaloniki, Greece.\nMany of the graphic images on the ex librises were the work of Georgian painters, so their donation to the National Centre of Manuscripts is a very important contribution to preserving the heritage of Georgian manuscripts. They carry additional information about the life and creative work of Georgia\u2019s artists and important public figures.\n\u201cFrom ProCredit Bank\u2019s side we are extremely delighted to have had the chance to support Georgia\u2019s culture and inheritance of manuscripts. It\u2019s extremely rewarding to have had the chance to hand over this unique and interesting collection of ex librises to the National Centre of Manuscripts; that we had the opportunity to obtain these very interesting examples of Georgian culture and history. By handing this collection today to the National Centre of Manuscripts we also, one more time, want to demonstrate our support for the development of Georgian culture. All in all I think it\u2019s a very promising beginning for a hopefully fruitful and long-lasting relationship with the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\n\u201cIn the National Centre of Manuscripts there are manuscripts, historical documents, archival materials and library collections. This is one of the largest collections across the country. It has been gathering material and growing since the 19th century; this process is still ongoing and will never be finished. The collection has mainly grown from people\u2019s donations, except for a few exceptions. Over the years we received donations from individuals, families, from private companies, public and private organizations. And the result is a unique collection which is now protected by the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d he added.\n\u201cToday, one of the priorities for us is searching for new materials and continuing the pursuit of our great ancestors, who began collecting such materials in the 19th century. We also have another sub-priority, as just like this material was found in a foreign country, great care is needed not to lose Georgia-related materials that may be located abroad. They shouldn\u2019t fall into someone else\u2019s hands, in some cases private collectors. Then the trace will be lost,\u201d Buba Kudava said.\n\u201cWe were searching over the internet with our colleagues for information of this sort, and we managed to connect with an individual in Thessaloniki, Greece. We asked them to send us information on a regular basis about Georgia-related materials. And indeed they sent us the ex libris collection and when we showed this material to experts, it turned out to be very interesting. There are many famous figures associated with these ex librises. On the one hand, one part of this collection was designed by well-known artists. The second part is known because it is created for famous statesmen, but by a lesser-known Georgian painter. The first is the Elene Akhvlediani ex libris, the second is the Sergo Kobuladze ex libris. We did not have a separate collection of ex librises until now. Of course there are such materials in archives and in books, but so far we have not had such an amount of ex librises,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEx librises were invented along with book printing and were an integral part of a book through the ages. Today, some of them are considered works of art. That is why participation in such a project is very important for ProCredit Bank, and we are very pleased that this unique ex libris collection has been added to the heritage of Georgian manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\nThe term \u201cex libris\u201d is Latin for \u201cfrom the library of\u201d, and is used to describe a printed label on the inside front cover of a book indicating the name of the owner. In the past, ex librises often took the form of a drawing, an emblem or an illustration of some famous event, sometimes by a famous artist.",
    "wm_text": " Sometimes ex libris took the form of a photograph or a picture, inserted into the book as a small picture inside the book.\nIn modern practice, however, ex libris are often the handiwork of the book illustrator himself, and the name is simply copied over the titlepage of the book. A book with an ex libris issued before the beginning of the full use of electronic media would often be displayed in an exhibition or displayed on a bookcase.\n---\nFollow the author on Twitter: @vjdvovanche\nFollow Trend on Telegram.

Some simply copied books that they liked, while others simply wanted to make their collection unique.\nThe collection of ex libris sent to the National Centre of Manuscripts by ProCredit Bank has a historical and cultural significance.

It is used to treat infections caused by bacteria such as E.coli and Streptococcus A. It does not cause drowsiness. It is recommended to take amoxicillin for 5 days. If your child is having trouble eating or drinking, vomiting..etc, take him to the doctor as soon as you can.\n\nAnswered by Dr. Sumit Jain from City Hospital, Bangalore on May 23, 2017\n\nanswer 3\n\nParacetamol, amoxicillin and probiotics should be given as per your paediatrician's advice.\n\nAnswered by Dr. Sumit Jain from City Hospital, Bangalore on May 23, 2017\n\nanswer 4\n\nParacetamol is used to decrease fever. It is not linked to drowsiness or is not habit forming. Amoxicillin may be fatal for children if not given under medical supervision. Naturally, paracetamol should be given in adequate doses.\n\nAnswered by Dr. Sumit Jain from City Hospital, Bangalore on May 23, 2017\n\nanswer 5\n\nParacetamol helps in relieving the fever. Amoxicillin is used for the treatment of bacterial infections. Try to give the antibiotic as per the doctor's advice.\n\nAnswered by Dr. Sumit Jain from City Hospital, Bangalore on May 23, 2017\n\nanswer 6\n\nAmoxycilin is very effective at killing bacteria but is still considered an antibiotic because it will kill the good bacteria in the colon and cause the bad bacteria to come to the surface. So the doctor might be prescribing just the pills so they are not habitual.\n\nAnswered by Dr. Sumit Jain",

    "text": "On Jan. 15, nine of 12 members of the National Park System Advisory Board sent a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announcing their resignation, effectively dissolving the board.\nIt was an act of protest against an administration with little appetite for the methodical approach the board has brought to national park management for decades. And it leaves the National Park Service without a means to establish new historic or natural landmarks, since federal law requires the advisory board to sign off on such designations. More significantly, perhaps, it\u2019s another crack in the foundation of the Interior Department, which manages 500 million acres of public land and is already rattled by the prospect of some 4,000 job cuts.\nSince 1935, the nonpartisan experts on the National Park System Advisory Board have consulted with the Park Service on its policies and recommended new park units. Lady Bird Johnson served on the board, as did Western writer Wallace Stegner and numerous anthropologists, archaeologists, biologists, architects and social scientists. In recent years, the board has taken a special interest in protecting sites that are of value to Asian-American, African-American, Latino and LGBT communities, and it\u2019s advised the Park Service on management strategies to deal with the impacts of climate change.\nWhen Zinke took office last spring, board members hoped to talk with him about these efforts. But the secretary seemed uninterested\u2014perhaps not surprising, given that a leaked document outlining his department\u2019s priorities scrubbed all mentions of climate change and diversity. In May, Zinke suspended the advisory board, along with some 200 other independent committees that offered management expertise to individual parks or regions. With few options to make their voices heard, advisory board members decided to resign en masse.\nInterior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift did not respond to a request for comment, but told the conservative Washington Examiner that the department \u201cwelcomes\u201d the resignations of members who she claims ignored sexual harassment issues in the Park Service.\nFormer Alaska governor and advisory board chairman Tony Knowles says sexual harassment didn\u2019t fall under the board\u2019s purview. He also talked with High Country News about why he quit and what the board\u2019s dissolution means for the national park system. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\nHCN: Did you get the sense that until this year, the recommendations of the board were heeded, or at least heard?\nTony Knowles: Yes, absolutely. Over the past 7 years, we really made a difference in the direction of the National Park Service. There was a great sense of collaboration. Our board members worked with more than 160 outside experts to come up with recommendations, including to approve 130 new historical landmarks. We went over recommendations carefully with former superintendent Jon Jarvis, and often they became part of Park Service policy.\nHCN: How did that change in the past year?\nTK: At the beginning, we were told that all of the advisory boards were suspended and we\u2019d be notified when it would become part of the agenda to reinstate them. So we waited one, two, three, four months. There was no contract (to allow us to continue our work), no understanding of when a Park Service director would be appointed. In early October, I wrote a letter to Secretary Zinke explaining how the board wanted to meet to inform the new administration of what we envisioned to build a better park system in the 21st century, and to hear what their vision was. We got no answer. I pestered and pestered, and in mid-November got a one-sentence email from someone saying the secretary was very busy. That\u2019s when we realized they were just running out the clock until our terms expired in May.\nHCN: Why did you decide to resign rather than try to influence the direction of the agency from within?\nTK: When you\u2019re on permanent hold, at some time you\u2019ve gotta hang up. There\u2019s no one to talk to but yourselves. By nine of us resigning, we felt we\u2019d be able to get the microphone briefly to at least talk to the American people about climate change, about preserving the natural diversity of wildlife, about making sure underrepresented minorities not only come to the parks but are employees there. All these things we think are important. We may be disappointed with the Department of the Interior, but we are not discouraged. Every single one of us will continue the fight to promote and protect our public lands.\nHCN: Given that your action is part of a larger pattern of resignations and layoffs at the Park Service, are you concerned about the agency\u2019s future?\nTK: Of course we\u2019re concerned. The secretary proposed a 13 percent budget reduction, which would all come out of personnel, then claimed he\u2019s going to rebuild infrastructure by raising park entry fees. If we\u2019re trying to increase the number of people from lower-income groups who want to come to our parks, that\u2019s counter-productive. I also get worried when I think about the unprecedented reduction of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah. We think those could be a preview of coming attractions for the National Park Service.",

I know of one guy who went to work as a park ranger and is now being forced out. No one was told that could happen. We\u2019re hearing the same things in other federal agencies.\nHCN: Do you think the full Senate will confirm Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s pick to succeed him at the agency?\nTK: I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t heard anything about that. The president\u2019s cabinet keeps growing. You got a guy this week (Eliott) Lappin who is being flown by helicopter to meet with members of the Senate. He\u2019ll be the nominee for fisheries in the department. He\u2019ll need 60 votes to secure his position, which means at least eight Democrats. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to vote if they don\u2019t know who he\u2019ll be working for.\nReprinted from High Country News with permission.\nFollow @ccfaessay on Twitter.",

We didn\u2019t give the superintendent a hard time, we never gave him a hard time, because we wanted to work with him.

We\u2019ve had some who wanted to move the process forward. We\u2019ve had some who felt it would be better to let the Park Service make more decisions.

That time was only a few decades ago, when the fusion of the Western pop music and Indian classical was the flavour of the day. Today, it has become common to find Indian classical music being played with Western rock or jazz influences. Some of the best of the songs from the great composers like Ravi Shankar and the latest Guru Nanak, too have been jazzed up. The latest diamond in this glittering crown is the CD by Naveen Kaur, the talented daughter of the legendary Ustad Amir Khan. Kaur's disc brings together some of the best of Indian classical with the western rock and jazz. She has brought together the best musicians India has to offer and the result is absolutely fabulous. This CD is a celebration of the fusion of Indian classical music and rock. It is not just the mixing of the two but also the blending of the musical styles in an interesting way that has gone a long way in helping to establish Indian classical music as a popular form of music everywhere. Kaur has managed to showcase the Indian classical music in a fresh and exciting way in this very adult format.\nVidyasagar, The Times of India\n\nReview: This is an interesting album, marrying the music of Indian classical with the jazz. The playlist includes not only the classic compositions by Ravi Shankar but also some compositions by the great jazz musician, Miles Davis. Although, the composer has used different versions of the same compositions, they are all done with great imagination. It is a great learning experience for the listener as well as for the musicians who are learning these compositions.\n\nReview: As a jazz violinist, I am always the first to look for new material and to hear the new faces. So, I was delighted when I heard about this album. I immediately bought it and listened to it several times",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2013 A lawsuit filed Wednesday against ABC (search) and \"American Idol\" judge Simon Cowell (search) alleges they conspired to steal the brand and concept of \"Million Dollar Idea,\" a series airing in syndication.\nThe suit, filed in federal court by Jean Golden and Todd Walker, the creators and hosts of \"Million Dollar Idea,\" (search) follows ABC&apos;s announcement in July of a new show of the same name that the network said was created by Cowell.\n\"From stem to stern, each and every detail of Simon Cowell and ABC&apos;s mock &apos;Million Dollar Idea&apos; is a patent rip-off of Todd and Jean&apos;s four-year labor of love,\" attorney Pierce O&apos;Donnell alleged in a statement Wednesday.\nThe lawsuit sees to stop ABC from using the name and idea and calls for unspecified damages. O&apos;Donnell predicted they would reach into \"the tens of millions of dollars.\"\nA call seeking comment from Cowell was not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\"We have not even been served with the complaint in this matter, and so have no comment,\" said ABC spokeswoman Annie Fort.\nThe suit also names FremantleMedia North America, producer of FOX&apos;s \"American Idol\" and proposed producer of ABC&apos;s \"The Million Dollar Idea.\" (Note the slightly different title.) FremantleMedia does not comment on pending litigation, spokesman Brian Reinert said.\n\"Million Dollar Idea\" first aired on KSTC-TV in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market in 2003. The series was recently syndicated to more than 125 stations nationwide and its creators registered for both copyright and trademark for the show&apos;s name and premise, according to their statement.\nThe show is taped before an audience and judges at the Mall of America. New product inventors and marketers from across the country compete for a prize package to help launch their product and place it for sale with a Mall of America retailer.\nThe syndicated series has received newspaper, magazine and TV coverage, including on NBC&apos;s \"Today\" show, the suit says.\n\"It is incredibly ironic that our show, the premise of which is to promote, protect and reward small-town American ingenuity, was itself the victim of corporate theft and greed,\" Golden said.\nHer partner, Walker, pitched a deal for the show to ABC in early 2004 and provided copies of their presentation to CAA, according to the suit. That&apos;s the same agency identified in a recent ABC press release as having \"packaged\" \"The Million Dollar Idea\" with Cowell.\nBesides the alleged theft of the title, every major concept connected to the show also was copied, the suit claims.\nIn the July 13 news release announcing \"The Million Dollar Idea,\" ABC described the series as \"a nationwide search for America&apos;s greatest entrepreneur with the best business idea or new product,\" with the prize to be $1 million \"worth of business support,\" including cash and other resources.\nThe idea was conceived by Cowell and British entrepreneur Peter Jones, according to the ABC release.",
    "wm_text": " Cowell said in the July release that the show is a \"natural\" extension of the current \"American Idol\" success and would give entrepreneurs a chance to explore and develop their product or service.\nABC&apos;s release says Cowell and Jones would join judges Ed Yardeni, chairman of Yardeni Research; retail analyst Jim Barrett; and attorney and television personality Linda Luddy to help match potential inventors and businesses.\n\"American Idol\" is currently airing on FOX, where auditions for its eighth season were held earlier this year.

    "text": "While many restaurants in New York City have close relationships with farmers, and boast unimpeachable farm-to-table ethics, far fewer have actual gardens wherein they grow the produce that\u2019s used on their plates. Six great restaurants with their very own gardens follow. Call them \u201croof to table.\u201d By Jessica Allen.\nAtop a 100-year-old building in the West Village grow lettuces, bicolor squash, fennel, dill, parsley, poblano peppers, Japanese eggplant, and tomatoes, among other things, using soil-less, solar-powered hydroponic technology. Bell, Book & Candle incorporates these and other vegetables and herbs into its New American food. Being so close to the source means the chefs don\u2019t refrigerate the produce. In fact, they call the freshly grown produce \u201cdormant, not dead,\u201d since the roots are kept attached until the very last second before cooking.\nRoberta\u2019s might look like a bunker from the outside, but inside the message is all about love\u2014love of good food, love of food to create change, love of the community that comes together around good food. Behind its scruffy exterior lie terrific pizza and pasta, a radio station, a greenhouse, and a very big garden. You can see what\u2019s growing via the garden\u2019s blog, with its photos of violets, edible weeds, raspberries, basil, strawberries, watermelon, peaches, chard, and blackberries, or you can take a seat in the wooden-paneled dining room, beneath a pizza party Barbie and board games, and order whatever\u2019s just been harvested.\nLike most Westin properties around the world, the newest one in New York City features luxurious amenities like the Heavenly Bed\u00ae (definitely worth its copyright in plushness), in-room Starbucks coffee, and special velour robes. But this hotel also has its very own organic garden, 384 feet above 42nd Street, supplying veggies and herbs to The LCL: Bar & Kitchen on site. This means fresh mint for mojitos and other cocktails, heirloom tomatoes for gazpacho and other dishes, mesclun lettuce for salads, grilled squash and zucchini as seasonal sides, and everything and anything else Executive Chef Brian Wieler (pictured) can cook up.\nModeled on a shebeen, an informal dining hall, and named for Nelson Mandela, Madiba claims to be the first South African restaurant of its kind in the United States. It opened in Fort Greene in 1999. Its rooftop garden is the source of at least some of the produce on the bushman\u2019s vegetable platter (pictured), including yellow squash, asparagus, string beans, baby bok choy, corn on the cob, spinach, and fat triangles of garlic. This dish serves as a counterpart to meatastic South African braai, or barbecue, a specialty of the restaurant.\nThe people behind Brooklyn Grange, the world\u2019s largest rooftop soil farms, helped construct a much smaller one atop Rosemary\u2019s, an Italian enoteca and trattoria in the West Village. Here, on 1,700 square feet, grow peppers, radishes, arugula, basil, broccoli rabe, and all kinds of organic goodness. Picked produce arrives in the kitchen in a basket using a block and tackle. An actual basket! Not content with herbs and veggies, restaurateur Carlos Suarez has expanded the garden to include a chicken coop and beehive. Diners are sometimes allowed up for a peek.\nWhen chef/restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten and his partners decided to build a rooftop garden 10 stories above Broadway to supply ABC Kitchen with microgreens, herbs, and other produce, they sought out seeds from farmers at the Union Square Greenmarket. In addition to what gets harvested upstairs, the seasonal, oft-changing menu at this James Beard award-winning restaurant includes sustainable, locally sourced (when possible) meat, dairy, seafood, and produce, free of antibiotics and pesticides, along with beverages whose ingredients come from fair-trade cooperatives.",
    "wm_text": "\nSoaring several stories above Chinatown is this little oasis, where you can find a selection of locally sourced, organic foods in an intimate dining room. From the garden (actually a maze-like network of 14 raised beds planted with all manner of delicious leaves, greens, and fruit) come kale, broccoli rabe, mint, thyme, cilantro, and watermelon. The menu\u2019s small-plate focus means vegetables are never tossed aside, but are chefs\u2019 ingredients, too. The pecan-topped bruschetta pictured was made with tomatoes grown in the restaurant\u2019s garden. You can find a full list of ingredients and fresh produce in the restaurant\u2019s garden on the restaurant\u2019s garden blog.\nWhen it comes to high-end, farm-to-table cuisine, chef Stephanie Izard (above, center, in blue) leads the way, along with her staff at Girl and the Goat and restaurants in Chicago and Las Vegas. Not only does the Girl and the Goat have its own farm (only farm, it turned out), but it also works with more than 30 area farms. Alongside, or literally on, that farm, its chefs keep food in Southern Illinois CSA-style, and harvest it on regular weekends. All of the ingredients, whether purchased from the farm, or made at the restaurant\u2019s own farm, are then used in dishes like the whole roasted red pepper and pine-nut salad pictured, which is one of the first dishes to appear on the daily dinner menu.\nPhoto: Patricia Cohen, New York Post",

    "no_wm_text": "\n\nNot to be outdone by the other rooftop gardens on this list, this one in SoHo is a little on the vast side. It looks more like a small farm from the street, and stretches 14,000 square feet. In addition to salad greens and other greens, vegetables for use in the kitchen and on the menu include carrots, butternut squash, tomatoes, and herbs, along with other herbs for use in the garden, like thyme and sage. Some vegetables, like zucchini, are raised in a greenhouse; others are picked by hand and delivered to customers in the basket pictured.\nIn one of the most startling transformations of the past decade, Chelsea Market has gone from being an overcrowded, noisy museum to a thriving business district, teeming with high-end restaurants and bars, including a couple from the Tavern group\u2014David Bouley and Michael White, two of the city\u2019s most successful restaurateurs. In the early 2000s, the building received more than $100 million in makeovers, and now is home to one of the city\u2019s most popular rooftop gardens, inhabited by approximately 20,000 plants ranging from tomatoes to okra to eggplants.\nThis massive space in Coney Island is home to an impressive amount of produce, including 400 herbs, an apple orchard containing more than 100 varieties, 80 varieties of corn, and the largest fresh produce market in the eastern United States. Our favorite dish here is the barbecued ostrich burger, served with pickles, onions, and barbecue sauce.\n\nFrom its rooftop garden, Michael White\u2019s Tavern group has created a breathtaking, multi-course meal, including sliders made from grass-fed, antibiotic-free beef, and a shrimp-and-fava-bean spread called \u201cFootslogger\u201d\u2014a name lifted from the swimming pool of the old Waldorf Astoria.

    "text": "BEAVER \u2014 After every practice and every game, coach Greg Huston reminds his Beaver girls basketball team that everything they do on the basketball court is a learning experience.\nOn Thursday night, the young and inexperienced Bobcats learned again that they can compete with any team in their section.\nBut to consistently win games against the better teams in the section, they have to play a little bit better than they did in a 63-61 loss to Avonworth.\nThe bright spot for Beaver, 7-2 overall and 3-1 in the section, was how it battled back after trailing by 11 points, 53-42, midway in the fourth quarter.\nFrom that point, the Bobcats went on a 19-8 run and tied the game, thanks to some clutch outside shooting. In the last 3 minutes, they knocked down five three-pointers.\nSophomore guards Anna Blum and Natalie Priest each made two 3s down the stretch. Freshman forward Payton List added one.\nWith 3 seconds left, Priest\u2019s bomb from long distance tied the game, 61-61.\nBut just when it seemed like the game was headed to overtime, Avonworth guard Harris Robinson was fouled just past the midcourt line with less than a second on the clock \u2026 0.2 seconds to be exact.\nShe calmly sank both free throws for a win that put Avonworth (6-3, 4-0) in sole possession of first place.\nHayden Robinson, a 5-foot-10 senior forward who\u2019s going to Quinnipiac University on a track scholarship, led Avonworth with a game-high 22 points. Kathryn Goetz, a 5-9 junior forward, added 16 for the Antelopes.\nSophomore guard Emma Pavelek led Beaver with 20 points. Sophomore forward Maddi Weiland and Payton List scored 11 and 10, respectively.\n\u201cHuge win,\u201d said Avonworth coach Mark D\u2019Alessandris, an Aliquippa native who used to coach the Quips\u2019 girls team. \u201cWe\u2019re both competing for first place, and now we\u2019re in sole possession. We got a big game Monday when Neshannock comes to our gym.\nIt was Beaver who handed Neshannock its only section loss, 47-46, on the Lancers\u2019 home court on Dec. 13.\n\u201cAvonworth is really good,\u201d Huston said. \u201cI had them and Neshannock as the top two teams in the section. So I feel pretty good that we\u2019re playing right with them for as young as we are.",
    "wm_text": " I know our girls are learning. They played well enough to win tonight. It\u2019s good to learn this way on the road.\n\u201cIf we had won, it would maybe make it seem like we can beat anybody. Now we know that\u2019s not the case. We have to keep working hard and keep learning. Our kids won\u2019t be discouraged by this tonight because they know they\u2019re getting better, and we can compete with anybody.\u201d\nBeaver is going through a really good youth movement this year. The starting lineup features four sophomores and a freshman. The one senior is on the bench, playing with the junior varsity.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a really good group of kids who work hard,\u201d Huston said. \u201cI\u2019ve been really impressed with some of the things these kids have learned in such a short period of time.\u201d\nNot many teams lose to Beaver or Avonworth and feel good about it. The Bobcats did that at Neshannock when they lost by three on Dec. 13.\n\u201cThis was a great team effort \u2014 offense, defense and the whole gamut in between,\u201d Huston said. \u201cThe girls really played well. I\u2019m glad we had this experience tonight because it\u2019ll be really good for us in the long run. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll feel this way too many times this year.\u201d\nBeaver led 13-7 after the first quarter. Avonworth rallied to pull within 26-25 at halftime. The Antelopes led, 39-37, after three quarters, but the Bobcats battled back.\nBeaver made 10 three-pointers the first two quarters. The Bobcats made three the rest of the game, which was played before 1,500 fans in the Trojan Activities Center.\n\u201cI\u2019",

It was back-and-forth the whole way. We had one lead and they had one lead.\nWe had them down and then they had us down. It was good to see us stay composed and keep playing.\u201d\nWeiland, the Bobcats\u2019 leader in scoring, rebounding and blocks, picked up her sixth foul with 3:50 left in the third quarter.\n\u201cI really liked the way she played,\u201d Huston said. \u201cShe played through it.

    "text": "Hello fellow people who desire to change their habits.\nI want to start a habit of 30 minutes of yoga each morning before work. In order to do that, I would need to establish a morning routine AND wake up 30-40 minutes earlier than usual.\nI immediately became overwhelmed just thinking about this and already anticipating my failure. Considering I am not much of a morning person, and don\u2019t work out EVER, this is a rather ambitious goal.\n*Deep Breath* Upon reading further I learned that many people have a burst of motivation when they start a new habit \u2013 however this quickly fades after a slight slip up or when you realize there may be limits to your motivation. This is why itis important that your habit be EASY PEASY and require little to no motivation!\n\u2022\tDrink a full glass of water before my feet hit the floor (I leave it at my bedside all night, so I guess I ingest a little dust as well, maybe a gnat. Whatever).\n\u2022\tGo to the bathroom (I told you, easy, no motivation, but super exciting to cross off your list).\n\u2022\tClean out kitty kat\u2019s litter box (something I would sometimes have no problem skipping before initiating this challenge).\n\u2022\tEnjoy a cup of coffee (never actually skipped this before).\n\u2022\tTake vitamins (when I don\u2019t eat breakfast, I don\u2019t bother taking vitamins because you\u2019re supposed to take them with food. So this is another one that was easily skipped).\nYes, most of this stuff is stuff I would do anyway, but now I am doing it consciously, consistently, SKIPPING NOTHING, every day.\nI am only implementing this routine on BUSINESS DAYS. I have a feeling this is frowned up. But we\u2019re just going to go with it for now. I am on (business day) 9.\nAnyway, only one day in the last nine did I forget my vitamins. My first instinct was to recoil in failure, but I went easy on myself and just made sure I got back on the track the next (business) day.\nAnother important part of this challenge is logging your progress and being held ACCOUNTABLE. This is where YOU - my fellow habit changers come in!\nSo even though I\u2019m already a few days in \u2013 from here on I will check in each day to let everyone know I\u2019ve accomplished my EASY PEASY morning routine and will offer support and encouragement to the rest of you.",

It is one of my favorite things to do when I am out in nature, eyes closed and mind relaxed, wrapping my mind around the awareness of my breathing.\n\nI think it is the combination of the increasing light penetrating the darkness full of unknown, the smell of the pale, thin fog lifting slowly, the touch of the wind. It reminds me of the rainbow, a divine promise, a diamond in a rough, a sign of hope. I believe God is present in the sunrise, standing on the shores of the sea with a beautiful smile on his face.\n\nFriday, September 26, 2008\n\nAn interesting thing happened to me the other day. I was out on a run with my dog, who was so excited she ran so hard that she pulled a muscle and I ended up having to carry her the last mile home. I received more text messages than I could count, along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re a bad mother\u201d and \u201cyou should have somebody else take care of her\u201d. I also had a few people ask if I was okay. I\u2019m sure there were other messages, but this is the only one I saved.\n\nI immediately began to wonder why I would receive messages like this (all of them were from women who had children of their own). I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m the only one out running with their dog! I mean, I have been out there many times before (and after) with other dogs. I mean, why should I get hate mail for taking care of my dog? Why would I get ANY hate mail for anything, really?\n\nAnyway, I decided to do some reading and find out what was so special about my message. I quickly learned that there are a lot of people out there",

    "text": "SANOK, POLAND \u2014 In the far southeast corner of Poland, the warm summer air is resounding with the rasp of old-fashioned iron saws and the satisfying twack-twack-twack of ax blades on wood.\nHere, in the foothills of the Carpathians, an international crew of master timber craftsmen and students has been working on an intensely hands-on project that combines history, art and education. They are building a replica of the tall peaked roof and inner cupola of an ornate wooden synagogue that stood for 300 years in the town of Gwozdziec, now in Ukraine.\nThe replica, which will be 85 percent of the original size of the building, will be installed as one of the key components of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, currently under construction in Warsaw and scheduled to open in 2013.\nIts elaborate structure and the intricate painted decoration on the cupola ceiling will reproduce a form of architectural and artistic expression that was wiped out in World War II, when the Nazis put the torch to some 200 wooden synagogues in Eastern Europe. Many of them, like that in Gwozdziec, were centuries old and extraordinarily elaborate, with tiered roofs and richly decorative interior painting.\nThe Gwozdziec Synagogue, built in the 17th and 18th centuries, was a \u201ctruly resplendent synagogue that exemplified a high point in Jewish architectural art and religious painting,\u201d the architectural historian Thomas C. Hubka, an expert on the building, has written.\nConstructing the replica is a joint project of the museum in Warsaw and the Handshouse Studio, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization that emphasizes learning by building, particularly the reconstruction of historical structures and other objects.\nThe Browns conducted years of research on Eastern Europe\u2019s lost wooden synagogues before embarking on construction of the Gwozdziec replica in Sanok in May. They studied prewar photographs, drawings and other documentation, built models and made on-site investigations of wooden churches and other buildings still found in Poland and Ukraine.\nThere are also several impressive masonry synagogues within an easy drive of Sanok. The 18th-century synagogue in Lancut, now a museum, has beautifully restored interior painting and other decoration. One in Rymanow stood for decades as a ruin but has been partially rebuilt, with a tall peaked roof now protecting the vigorous but sadly fading frescoes of Biblical animals and Jerusalem that grace its walls.\nIn Lesko, the 17th-century synagogue was rebuilt in the 1960s and today houses a gallery of local arts and crafts. Lesko\u2019s vast Jewish cemetery, just a short walk away, is one of the oldest in Poland, with massive tombstones dating to the 16th century.\nFor the Gwozdziec project, an international team of nearly 30 master craftsmen from the Timber Framers Guild are being joined by groups of students from Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where the Browns teach.\nTimber framers came from the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Belgium and Japan to lend their skills, all on a volunteer basis.\nAll the work is being carried out using techniques and tools that the builders of the original synagogue would have used: axes, saws, mallets and other hand-held implements. The aim is to gain an understanding of just what went into the building of the synagogue and how its construction would have been envisaged and carried out \u2014 and also to lend authenticity to the replica.\n\u201cIt brings back the lost story of the synagogue, the town, this culture,\u201d said Patrick Goguen, a student at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.\nThe project is occurring in several stages. Building the timber-framed roof and cupola is the first stage, running through June. Students and artists will hold workshops this summer and next summer to reproduce the intricate polychrome painting that adorned the ceiling of the cupola. These workshops will be held in eight Polish towns in masonry synagogues that still stand.\nThe timber framing is taking place in a corner of Sanok\u2019s Ethnographic Park, a sprawling open-air folk-architecture museum that displays wooden buildings \u2014 houses, barns, churches, chapels and even beehives \u2014 that have been transferred from a number of villages in the region.\nHere, thick logs are being hewn by hand into flat-sided timbers \u2014 a process that can take two days per log \u2014 and then manually sawed into thinner pieces. The components are then shaped and joined without nails.",

The project is supported by the state of Sanok, which donated another building on the site where the replica will stand to house it.\nThe project\u2019s second stage is scheduled to begin this fall, when the replica will be installed and the interior painted. The project\u2019s third stage is scheduled to begin in late spring 2012 and entails construction of the two larger metal doors inside the synagogue.\nThe main doors will be placed in the two east-facing side wings, where they will face toward the inside of the synagogue. The two northernmost doors will face toward the west wing, where they will face outward. The doors, which will be about 2 1/2 feet tall, will be slightly smaller and smaller in diameter than the originals, which were slightly bigger than a regulation basketball.\nGoguen praised the skill and speed of the woodworkers, the precision of the sawing, the painstaking attention to detail and the patience that the craftsmen exhibit.\nYahya Cint-Habayeb, a student from Massachusetts College of Art and Design, said the builder of the replica was \u201ca true craftsman\u201d who understands what he is doing.\nRabbi Chaim Melamed, the chief rabbi of the state of Sanok, praised the Browns for their work.

If she had, permission would\u2019ve been denied.\nDespite her repeated denials, there were at least two attempts to hack into her system. Neither was ever reported to State\u2019s security personnel, as required.\nClinton claimed she used a private system strictly for convenience. But when urged to also use an official email address, she refused, citing the risk that personal emails might become publicly accessible.\nTellingly, Clinton and top aides Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Cheryl Mills refused to be interviewed by the IG.\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: Virtually everything Clinton has said about her emails has been a lie. And no longer can supporters laugh off Emailgate so easily.\nHillary\u2019s culpability and her flouting of the law now seem clear.

When all the full investigation is over, Hillary will not be able to keep her law license.\nBy the way, Hillary lied, too. She lied when she said she never sent classified information. She lied when she said she never had unauthorized access to it. You got a security clearance, Hillary?\n\nHillary's position on email is no problem for me. She does it. She is a woman,she has no choice. The problem is with her staff. The letter from the FBI should make it real clear to Hillary that they made mistakes. The letter should put Hillary in jail. If the FBI decides not to indict Hillary, then we need to impeach Loretta Lynch. The FBI should not be held to ransom and the heads of the FBI should not be used as shields for the left, or we will have to impeach the whole lot of them.\n\nI\u2019ve said it before, Hillary wants to be elected president of the United States but she does not want to be elected president of the United States of America (USA) - the USA.

If the test is confirmed, this would be the first known case of Ebola being contracted or transmitted in the United States.\nThe level of the virus in the woman\u2019s system was \u201clow,\u201d Frieden said, adding that another test to confirm whether she has the virus will be conducted later Sunday.\nFrieden said at least 48 people who came in contact with Duncan before he was admitted to the hospital in Dallas are at risk of contracting the virus.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola,\u201d Frieden said.\n\u201cThe risk is in the 48 people who are being monitored, all of whom have been tested daily, none of whom so far have developed symptoms or fever,\u201d Frieden said.\nAn \u201cintensive investigation\u201d is also being conducted to determine others who may have come in contact with Duncan while he was being treated, because they may have been exposed as well, Frieden added. Some of these workers could have had a breach in contamination control similar to the one that led to the nurse being infected, he said.\nWhen the nurse became feverish on Friday, she reported it and was given a preliminary test for the virus, which turned up positive Saturday night, Frieden said.\nThe CDC and Texas health officials are investigating how many people the nurse came in contact with after coming down with symptoms of the disease.\nFrieden said the CDC has sent additional staff to Dallas to assist with the response. The agency will also enhance training of health care workers who may have to treat patients with the virus.\nThe key to stopping the spread of the disease is to \u201cbreak the chains of transmission,\u201d he said. This involves promptly diagnosing anyone who has symptoms of the disease, isolating that individual, identifying everyone this person came in contact with and actively monitor those people over a 21-day period. If any of these contacts comes down with Ebola symptoms, then the same process starts over again.\nDavid Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, who also participated in the news briefing, agreed.\n\u201cI firmly believe we will stop it,\u201d Lakey said.",

These calls aren't free, though. As in Skype, if you want to use this service to call people on regular phones, you've got to buy credits on the system against them. Rates are either good or great, depending on where you're calling: For example, calling a landline or mobile phone in China is one cent a minute, but a call to a mobile in the U.K. is 15 cents a minute.\nIn order to make out-of-network calls, you call a central Jaxtr number that's local to you, and then tell it who you want to reach. Then it calls you back and connects you--the typical dial-around procedure. But with Jaxtr, you can save the incoming number and use it the next time you want to reach the same person.\nSkype has shown that a free telephony service can turn its free users into paying customers. Jaxtr also has another revenue stream: It has a free SMS service, in which message lengths are even more limited than normal text messages to Jaxtr can insert paid 40-character-long ads at the ends of messages.\nJaxtr is also announcing that it has closed a second round of funding: $10 million, led by Lehman Brothers. Jaxtr's first round was also $10 million, and the initial investors are contributing in this B round.",

Jaxtr plans to make it easier to distribute widgets and apps.\n\"As the use of mobile devices increases and out of network calls to landlines and mobile numbers become acceptable, our service will help give mobile users an additional service, ensuring that they have a great user experience as they use their phones,\" says Michael O'Hara, co-founder and president of Jaxtr.\n\"We're seeing a huge growth in mobile, which means our service will become even more valuable to mobile users as we can offer them the convenience of making out of network calls from the handset,\" he continues. \"An increasing portion of our mobile connections will come from users who are on the Web and mobile, and so our service will become even more compelling to mobile users who want a 'Jaxtr experience'.\"\n Jaxtr manages to keep its service running with half as many people as Skype does, but it's possible that the current trend toward phone-hopping in mobile usage will end up driving Jaxtr to more users than Skype does.\n\"It will become even less useful to keep my list longer than 30 people longer than the time I spend making the calls,\" O'Hara says. \"Phone users will want to make instant calls, and the longer you have to remember to make a call, the less likely that you'll use it.

Previous tax preparation knowledge and experience is desired but not necessary. However, the tax course material is covered rapidly, and without previous knowledge could be difficult due to its complexity. Some aspects of tax preparation are limited, not covered by the course, and cannot be done for tax payers with large stock portfolios, stock day traders, small businesses, and those with K-1 reports as part of their corporation holdings. Some volunteers serve as receptionist and assistants which does not require testing.\nPeople who wish to volunteer for the Winter Haven's AARP Tax-Aide program may contact Shirley Rafool at 863-294-4542 or for other locations, contact AARP 1-888-687-2277.",

    "text": "The final chapter in Roy Andersson's droll trilogy 'on being a human being' introduces three dozen more brilliantly absurd vignettes.\nIn a Venice Film Festival lineup full of cynicism, suicide and despair, who would expect the new Roy Andersson picture \u2014 \u201cthe final part of a trilogy on being a human being\u201d \u2014 to be the most life-affirming? And yet, from its comic title to the wistful smile that accompanies its over-too-soon last shot, Andersson\u2019s delightfully odd \u201cA Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence\u201d finds the Swedish master of comic absurdity feeling downright generous, perched at a comfortable enough distance from this coterie of sad sacks and lonelyhearts to recognize the humor in such painful subjects as mortality, aging, unpaid debts and unrequited love.\nJust last year, Ethan Hawke was quoted as referring to \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d and its two sequels as \u201cthe lowest-grossing trilogy in the history of motion pictures.\u201d But even he probably hasn\u2019t bought tickets to Andersson\u2019s incomparable triptych \u2014 rapturously received by critics, though audiences have proven all but allergic to the first two films, which have cleared barely $100,000 so far in the U.S. The result of four years of rigorous planning and meticulous execution, \u201cPigeon\u201d could fare slightly better than \u201cSongs From the Second Floor\u201d and \u201cYou, the Living\u201d (both of which bowed at Cannes), but only just. At least arthouse programmers can now get creative, treating Andersson\u2019s now-complete tragicomic opus, a decade and a half in the making, as the special event that it is.\n\u201cPigeon\u201d is by far the most accessible of the three films, offering a continuity throughline in the form of novelty salesmen Sam (Nils Westblom) and Jonathan (Holger Andersson), a comedic duo who\u2019d be right at home in a Samuel Beckett or Tom Stoppard play. Here, the Laurel-and-Hardy-esque pair appear in nearly one-third of the film\u2019s 37 fixed-camera compositions, a series of chuckle-inducing tableaux that clock in at just under three minutes apiece on average.\nEach of these shots serves as a nearly self-contained comic vignette, like a cross between a \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo\u201d cartoon and a Gregory Crewdson photograph, and the best way to approach them is as you might a large-canvas painting or a Jacques Tati film: Study the faces, soak up the details, allow the eye to wander and the mind to free-associate. Where other directors seek out exceptional moments, Andersson endeavors to capture the poetry of the mundane.\nWith the exception of one scene, in which twin girls blow bubbles from the balcony of a nondescript apartment building, and another that observes a plumpish new mom (Andersson loves his ladies with a little meat on their bones) cooing over her baby carriage, all the characters here are adults. Most of them have fewer days ahead of them than they do behind, but none seem to truly appreciate the gift of living. Andersson does, and he wants us to recognize it, too.\nRight up front, the helmer presents three \u201cmeetings with death\u201d: a husband who suffers a heart attack while struggling to uncork a wine bottle; an old lady convinced she can take her handbag to heaven; and a cruise-ship passenger who collapses at the lunch counter, having just paid for his meal (sorry, no refunds). More playful than his fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman, who famously challenged Death to a game of chess, Andersson recognizes that there\u2019s no cheating mortality \u2014 though sometimes we can speed it along, like the suicidal CEO glimpsed later in the film. Best just to have a sense of humor about it.\nSome critics have mistaken Andersson\u2019s movies as \u201cdepressing\u201d (while others have incorrectly labeled him a \u201ccommercials director,\u201d failing to understand that he accepted those commissions to finance his painstaking feature ventures). \u201cDroll\u201d would be a better word for the artist\u2019s attitude toward the washed-out blue and beige world he presents. His characters wear white face makeup to enhance their pallor, sleepwalking zombielike through their lives. Even the young couple seen necking on the beach appear to be doing so in slow-motion.\nIn the interval since his last film, Andersson has embraced hi-def digital cameras, which benefit his aesthetic enormously. Now, the helmer can ensure that even the far-distant background of every scene appears in sharp focus. Though the colors are dreary and the characters numb, compositionally speaking, there\u2019s not a single dull frame in the entire film. Andersson thinks like a painter, following Edward Hopper\u2019s example of enhancing loneliness by depicting it within a greater context. He shoots rooms at an angle, using perspective to direct our eyes toward the activity in adjacent rooms or on the other side of windows, instead of observing everything directly on axis, the way his similarly detail-oriented American namesake, Wes Anderson, insists on doing.\nIn \u201cPigeon,\u201d people go about their business in the dreary little boxes of their lives, but they don\u2019t behave like marionettes on strings, but almost like actors on a stage, occasionally turning to address the audience. \u201cToday I feel kind,\u201d announces a cheesemonger, while his wife gestures to the audience to let us know she thinks he\u2019s crazy.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the shift to digital has allowed Andersson to manipulate his footage the way directors such as David Fincher and Ruben Ostlund do, using their locked-down cameras to make invisible nips and tucks. Regardless of the method, the film is a master class in comic timing, employing pacing and repetition with the skill of a practiced concert pianist.\nEarly on, outside a dance studio where the flamenco teacher gets a little too hands-on with one of her pupils, a lady janitor says into her phone, \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d (Mobile phones are a rare nod to modern life in a film that appears to be set in a timeless retro past \u2014 and where King Charles XII and his infantry are prone to drop in unannounced, like characters in a Monty Python sketch.) The cleaning woman\u2019s line becomes a hollow platitude echoed by many of the characters by film\u2019s end, and yet, there\u2019s something to be said for merely surviving in such an absurd world as this.\nDown on their luck, Sam and Jonathan bill themselves as being in the \u201centertainment business,\u201d selling plastic vampire teeth and a corny laughing device engineered to amuse. These two friends look like they haven\u2019t smiled in a long, long time. Emerging as the most well-rounded character in the entire trilogy, Jonathan suffers from melancholy spells, culminating in a disturbing dream sequence, where colonial soldiers lead African slaves into a giant copper instrument that produces a beautiful sound as the people inside are being roasted alive. What a curious species are homo sapiens. Judging by the film, we wage war, torture animals and take advantage of one another, and yet, Andersson assures us, things could be worse. In the grand scheme of things, he\u2019s happy to show we\u2019re doing fine.\nProduction: (Sweden-Norway-France-Germany) A Roy Andersson Filmproduktion production, in co-production with 4 1/2 Fiksjon, Essentail Filmproduction, Parisienne de Production, Sveriges Television, Arte France Cinema, ZDF/Arte, with support from Svenska Filminstitutet, Eurimages Council of Europe, Nordisk Film- och TV Fond, Norska Filmfonden, Film- ind Medienstiftung NRW, CNC.

    "text": "Unprecedented back-to-back annual coral bleaching events have affected two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef, with this year's event already leading to mortality of half the corals in some key tourist tracts, scientists say.\nRecord-breaking warm waters along the Queensland coast has triggered widespread bleaching over 1500 kilometres of the World-Heritage-listed reef over the two summers, said Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.\nProfessor Hughes and his team completed aerial surveys last Wednesday after scoring about 800 separate reefs. The 8000km journey closely followed the path of the 2016 survey that found the northern regions of the Great Barrier Reef most affected.\n\"It's been a huge blow to the reef after last year the northern third was hit and now this year's it's the middle third,\" Professor Hughes said.\nCorals bleach when temperatures exceed tolerance levels for too long, prompting them to expel the algae that supply most of their energy and the brilliant colours. Not all bleached corals die but as much as two-thirds of north corals have succumbed.\n\"The mortality in the central region will continue to unfold over coming months,\" Professor Hughes said. \"We've already seen substantial mortality, up to 50 per cent on some central reefs in the past six weeks.\"\nBleaching has returned even to some of the regions hard hit last year, such as Cape York's Princess Charlotte Bay.\nSome 30 reefs in the north had no score as they \"effectively have ceased to exist at least in the shallow sections as coral reefs\", said James Kerry, a marine biologist from James Cook University who also took part in the survey.\nWhile this year's event is not expected to result in as much coral mortality as in 2016, there are worrying signs corals bleached at lower temperatures than a year earlier. That result may point to more bleaching next summer if conditions are again relatively warm.\n\"It seemed like the bleaching happened more quickly this year, which may suggest they are in a weakened, more stressed state following last year's event,\" Dr Kerry said.\nMark Read, manager of operations support at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said \"2017 has shaped up to be a pretty nasty year when it comes to coral bleaching\".\n\"The corals didn't get any respite at all,\" Dr Read said.\nBleaching, though, was patchy. The authority was already in talks with tour operators to redirect visitors to \"refugia\" where they can still enjoy \"a high-quality experience\", he said.\nSuch areas are likely to be harder to find in the Whitsunday region near Mackay where Cyclone Debbie carved a swathe about 100km wide through the reefs.\n\"The one area that was actually doing pretty good was the one that bore the brunt of the category 4 cyclone,\" Dr Read said. \"A lot of those massive corals are now lying on the beach in those locations. They've simply been snapped and rolled up onto the beach.\"\nTemperatures are showing signs of easing back to more typical levels for this time of year, such as the Davies Reef off Townsville.\nBut the area had been remarkably warm even in a non-El Nino year, such as during the previous 2015-16 summer.\nIn March, for instance, large areas of Queensland reported their hottest mean temperatures on record. These included the coastal region of the state's north adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.\nProfessor Hughes said some corals may regain their colour in the next three to six months, but it would take longer to see if they recovered their reproductive health and began a fuller recovery.\nThe faster growing branch corals and some other rapidly growing \"weedy\" species of corals could rebuild the reefs but the process would take years or even a decade. The loss of boulder corals would take much longer to recover from the bleaching.\nRising temperatures from global warming means the corals are likely to enjoy ever shorter stints between mass bleaching events, the scientists said.\n\"It's highly unlikely we'll have a period of calm for 10 or 20 years that will allow these reefs to re-establish to the point that they might be recognisable as they were,\" Dr Kerry said.\nDr Kerry said he was surprised the severity of the bleaching had not provoked more of a public response: \"I don't really know what else the reef needs to do to signify that it's in serious trouble.\"",
    "wm_text": "\nAustralia has dropped its ambition to meet a 2016 United Nations target to limit the rise in global warming to no more than 2C. The government is still set to meet a more modest goal to reduce Australia's carbon pollution levels by 26-28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030.\nComputer modelling by Professor Hughes and his colleagues suggests that if the global rise in temperature stayed within that two to three degree range, corals from the Great Barrier Reef would recover with little more than a small loss of reef cover.\n\"But if we see temperature rise beyond a two to three degree margin the reef is likely to suffer major damage and likely to suffer more severe damage every year,\" Professor Hughes said.",

We must never forget that Sinn Fein were willing and enthusiastic apologists for decades of human rights abuses perpetrated by the IRA.\n\u201cIt is hard to escape the conclusion that this is less about recognition and more about trying to impose an ideology that decades of brutal terror could not.\nLord Empey also accused the republican party of \u201cdesperately trying to pursue De Valera\u2019s ideal of recreating a mythical nation of true bred gaels, fluent in their ancient tongue \u2013 a tongue precious few of them can speak\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThe sub-text is clear. Those who do not speak Irish or who do not regard it as part of their identity and heritage are not truly Irish.\nIn his article, Mr Kearney also wrote: \u201cAn Ireland of equals will only come about once partition has been ended and a national democracy is achieved.\nTUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Kearney\u2019s comments should demonstrate to unionists that \u201cStormont for Sinn Fein is a waiting room for Irish unity\u201d.",

    "text": "These two healthcare REITs are trading for dirt-cheap valuations despite high dividends and a solid history of growth.\nInvesting in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, is one of the best ways to enjoy high dividends and the potential for capital growth. On a valuation basis, REITs specializing in healthcare properties are trading cheaply right now, and two seem to be a particularly good bargain: HCP Inc. (NYSE:HCP) and Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW).\nThis type of real estate should be an excellent long-term investment for three main reasons: demographics, increased healthcare spending, and market opportunity.\nDemographics indicate a growing demand for healthcare properties over the coming decades. Simply put, the population is getting older -- fast. The 65-and-up population in the U.S. is expected to nearly double by 2050 as baby boomers age and live longer. Older individuals require more healthcare, therefore the number of healthcare facilities will grow to meet the demand.\nFurthermore, healthcare costs are rising at a faster rate than other expenditures, as you can see in the chart below. Given that commercial properties derive most of their value from their ability to generate rental income, healthcare properties should appreciate faster than other property types as long as this trend continues.\nFinally, the healthcare real estate market is about $1 trillion in size, and no REIT has more than a 3% market share. The industry is highly fragmented, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for new investments from existing properties, in addition to the opportunities that will come from future growth of the industry.\nHCP is one of the \"big three\" healthcare REITs, and it owns 1,179 properties in a variety of categories -- mainly senior housing, post-acute care, life science, and medical office buildings. Essentially, the business model is to acquire attractive properties and team up with some of the best operating partners in the business, such as Brookdale Senior Living.\nThe company pays a notable 7.1% dividend yield and has an even more impressive record of dividend growth. In fact, HCP has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.\nHCP's biggest recent news item is the planned spinoff of its HCR ManorCare assets, which include virtually all of the post-acute/skilled-nursing properties in the company's portfolio. You can have an in-depth look at the spinoff, but the general goal is to allow HCP to focus on its private-pay senior housing, life science, and medical office properties, thereby improving portfolio quality and giving the company more financial flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. The spun-off assets, meanwhile, will be placed in a newly created REIT that will strive to maximize their value.\nAccording to HCP, once this happens, the company can employ several new strategies with these properties, including some that are not possible or practical while the assets are still a part of HCP.\nData source: HCP company presentation.\nMedical Properties Trust focuses on hospital properties, which, according to the company, produce better initial yields than other types of healthcare real estate. In fact, the company is the fourth-largest owner of for-profit hospital beds in the country.\nData source: Medical Properties Trust.\nThe company has 204 properties located in 29 states and four foreign countries, and the long-term plan calls for even further international diversification. This way, if one market faces headwinds (say, the U.S.), it won't represent virtually all of Medical Properties' assets.\nThe company does have a relatively high debt load for a REIT: Debt represents 51.6% of Medical Properties' assets, so there's added risk to consider. However, 98% of the portfolio's leases have annual rent increases built in, and the company's payout ratio is less than two-thirds of FFO -- lower than that of most peers.\nIn short, there's no reason to believe Medical Properties Trust will have any debt-related issues going forward, with a growing stream of income that's already more than enough to cover the dividend.\nNote: Share prices and guidance are current as of 5/23/16. Normalized or adjusted FFO guidance is used when available.\nNo stock with double-digit growth potential is without risk, and these two are certainly no exception. In fact, a higher level of perceived risk is responsible for the low valuations. Healthcare spending could slow, operating partners could face greater financial difficulties, or there could be a shortage of attractive acquisition opportunities in the target property types. Any one of these factors could cause these stocks to take a dive.\nHowever, I think the growth potential and the solid track record of delivering profits in a variety of economic climates more than make up for the risks. Either of these healthcare REITs would make a solid addition to a well-diversified dividend growth portfolio.",

    "text": "The SNP's internal feud reached new depths of bitterness last night when party leader Alex Salmond was told by treasurer Ian Blackford to apologise for criticisms made last week or face being sued for defamation.\nAs moves continued to oust Mr Blackford, the party was also preparing disciplinary action against one of his closest allies, Ms Margo MacDonald, who faces accusations of breaking internal rules by publicly challenging a parliamentary group decision.\nMs MacDonald, a critic of Mr Salmond's leadership style, will be dealt with on Thursday at a meeting which her supporters claim could mark the start of a campaign to have her deselected.\nNationalist spokesmen desperately sought to play down the effects of the furious row which erupted between Mr Salmond and Mr Blackford last week over reports that the SNP was in deep financial trouble.\nPress officer Kevin Pringle refused to give details of the behind-the-scenes leadership attack on Mr Blackford at the weekend party executive meeting which passed a motion of no confidence in him by 18 votes to three.\nSNP rules allow the executive to admonish, suspend or expel a member - which some observers think could be the leadership's next move if Mr Blackford stays put.\nParty insiders have pointed privately to Mr Blackford as the source of recent stories about the SNP's financial state. Mr Blackford has hotly denied any wrongdoing. The cause of the row is Mr Blackford's reputedly hard line as treasurer in drawing up tough housekeeping rules for the party which is in debt.\nHe is thought privately to believe Mr Salmond and former chief executive Michael Russell, together spent irresponsibly during the Scottish Parliament elections and then left him to clear up the financial mess. Mr Blackford has repeatedly said that as a prominent and wealthy banker in Edinburgh he must ensure his conduct is above reproach because his professional reputation is on the line.\nThe latest dispute between the leader and treasurer involves the extent of the party's overdraft and the effectiveness of Mr Blackford's efforts to have it cleared before the General Election.\nHe and Mr Salmond were involved in an acrimonious dispute last summer after The Herald revealed that Stagecoach millionaire Brian Souter had made a major contribution - said to be about #200,000 - to the SNP but had not been named as the source. Rules at the time did not require the identity of major donors to be revealed but parties had agreed to abide by the spirit of the new procedures.\nMr Blackford irritated Mr Salmond, who claimed the SNP had behaved perfectly properly, with his insistence that there must be no ''jiggery pokery''.\nRelations between the two men have never recovered and hit a new low last week with newspaper claims that the SNP was broke and had been forced to sell its Edinburgh HQ to help pay off an overdraft believed to be #400,000.\nIn fact, the SNP had planned long ago to sell its offices. The party is believed to have struck an agreement on the sale last week and it must now find a new headquarters.\nProceeds from the sale are not expected to be used in clearing the overdraft which deputy party leader John Swinney predicted last month would be paid off around the end of this year and which was about #600,000 at its worst.\nMr Blackford, who is reputedly wealthy, told Radio Clyde that when he was involved in talks with his bank about personally helping the SNP out of its financial difficulty, Mr Salmond was encouraging former party leader Willie Wolfe to run against him as treasurer. Mr Wolfe subsequently withdrew. ''I don't need lessons from Alex Salmond on integrity or trust,'' Mr Blackford said.\nThe SNP would not confirm a report that Mr Salmond accused Mr Blackford of incompetence and of destabilising the party and had appeared to blame him for the overspend.\nHe rejected suggestions that he and allies like Ms MacDonald were being purged as an offensive against dissidents. ''I don't believe in conspiracy theories,'' he said.\nMr Blackford pointed out that his treasurer's report to the national council last month had been accepted without questioning.\nMs MacDonald incurred the wrath of the leadership when she complained publicly about the parliamentary party's refusal to set aside SNP debating time in the chamber for her ideas for exploring the use of cannabis, particularly as an aid to those suffering pain. She accused some of her colleagues of ''reneging'' on the issue.\nbetween the leader and treasurer.\nLabour revelled in the SNP disarray. Scotland Office Minister Brian Wilson said: ''Alex Salmond's control freak tendencies have finally come home to roost. Having ousted the party treasurer in the night of the long sgian dubhs he has now turned his sights on the independence-minded Margo MacDonald.",
    "wm_text": " If this is what Alex Salmond's plans for an 'inclusive' SNP are then they are in peril.\n''It is clear to all that Alex Salmond's personal power over the SNP has led to the departure of the national treasurer and the expulsion of the independence-minded Margo MacDonald.

    "text": "Tennessee farmers are cashing in on the local food movement.\nThe federal government never measured just how much Tennessee farmers sold directly to customers at, say, a farmers market, but when it did (for the first time this year), it found a huge, farm-fresh, steaming pile of cash.\nTennessee consumers spent more than $58.7 million with farmers directly in 2015, according to the first survey on direct-to-consumer sales from the federal government. Across the country, Tennessee ranks 15th for the number of farms selling directly to consumers.\n\"We know that many people care about what they eat and want to know where their food comes from,\" said Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jai Templeton. \"This survey shows what that farmer-to-consumer relationship is worth in Tennessee.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture conducted the survey to get data on the growing and changing local-food sectors across the country. It found that 4,148 Tennessee farms sold food directly to consumers in 2015, and more are getting in the game in a hurry.\n\"The number of farms selling directly to consumers increased more than 500 in the three years since the [last agriculture census],\" said Debra Kenerson, a Tennessee state statistician. \"This shows tremendous growth in a short period of time.\"\nThe farm sales include fresh foods like meat and vegetables but also edible processed foods like bottled milk, cheese, meat, jam, cider, and wine. Farmers sold these goods to institutions like schools, universities, hospitals, wholesalers, and distributors.\nBut farmers also sold their goods directly to the person who would eat them at farmers markets, farm stores, roadside stands, through community supported agriculture (CSA) arrangements, online sales, pick-your-own operations, and mobile markets.\nSandy Watson, a board member with the Cooper-Young Community Farmers Market, said the more consumers are educated on the importance of eating locally sourced, healthy food, the more likely they are to hit farmers markets for their weekly grocery shopping.\nThis, Watson said, is fueling the local food movement. That movement is responsible for the year-over-year growth seen at the Cooper-Young market and responsible for the big numbers the government found when looking at direct-to-consumer farm sales.\nThose big sales figures, too, provide a \"real opportunity for more farmers to capitalize on the 'buy local' movement,\" Kenerson said.\nThe strength of that \"buy local movement\" is a big reason the Cooper-Young market is now open year-round.\n\"We don't stop eating when winter comes, and many of the local farmers are producing year-round,\" Watson said. \"Our winter market is just as busy as the spring/summer market, and some of the best vegetables are those grown in the winter.\"\nWhile much of the food consumed in Memphis was not likely grown here, a move is underway to change that. Last year, the East Arkansas Planning and Development District and the Memphis-Shelby County Office of Sustainability launched Delta Roots: The Mid-South Regional Food System Plan.\nThe plan lays out a 20-year path to a local, sustainable food network here in which consumers will eat more locally grown products and farmers can cash in on the $550 million annual demand for produce in the Memphis area.",

    "text": "MURFREESBORO \u2014 I guess my older son\u2019s mother and I always knew it would happen: college move-in day.\nI\u2019d been noticing on Facebook where co-workers, friends and others had incoming freshmen moving into their dorm, and this past weekend, actually just a really long Saturday, it was our turn.\nMy son Jonathan is officially a Middle Tennessee State University freshman. He went down Saturday in one car and his parents in another.\n\u2014 Even with a GPS, things don\u2019t always work out as planned. His mother and I headed down Interstate 81 and then I-40 toward Nashville. He ended up taking I-75 toward Chattanooga at the I-81 and I-40 split east of Knoxville. However, his phone GPS directed him a different way after his southern turn and he beat us there by at least 20 minutes.\n\u2014 If you travel with a gumball machine, don\u2019t put the gumballs in until you get to your destination without a top on the machine. My ex\u2019s rear floorboard was full of gumballs before we left Kingsport.\n\u2014 If you ever make a trip to Murfreesboro, when you make the exit off I-40 to I-840, be forewarned there are no gas stations until you reach Murfreesboro, about 22 miles. We realized this as the gas gauge was about on empty. On much of I-40 there are gas stations galore, often at every exit.\n\u2014 Once we got to Mufreesboro and then campus, we relied more heavily on GPS to guide us since we weren\u2019t familiar with the campus or the city. After the third time of being directed to turn left onto Mount Sue Boulevard, I realized the GPS meant MTSU Boulevard. Hmm, Big Blue of Mount Sue? At least it rhymes.\n\u2014 Always check to be sure the dorm refrigerator works and have a checklist of items. After his refrigerator didn\u2019t cool, he told me it had been about two years since the fridge had been used. As of last word, it was still not working. I guess a new fridge might be in his future unless he snags his sister Erica\u2019s refrigerator from her old room at home. He also forgot his backpack and extra car key and remote but plans to get those, and maybe another fridge, when he visits here in September. He also didn\u2019t take his 50-plus-inch television, at least yet.\n\u2014 Listen to the keynote convocation speech. This one was by attorney Bryan Stevenson, author of \u201cJust Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption,\u201d the freshmen summer reading selection. A black man who grew up on the proverbial wrong side of the tracks, he went to Harvard Law School and became a defender and champion of the downtrodden. He has argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and is to do so again later this year.\nHe has spent his career fighting against racism, against other discrimination and for justice and for equality. His message was for the class of 2022 to become involved and try to make things better, to get up close and personal with people so they could make a difference just like an attorney needs to get to know about his clients before helping them.\nFunny, he didn\u2019t say a thing about GPS pronunciations, spilled gumballs and not-so-cool refrigerators. Maybe there\u2019s a book there? Future convocation keynote speech, here I come.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Secretary of State Colin Powell (search) has been evasive about his future, skirting questions about the timing of his widely expected departure after four rough-and-tumble years as America&apos;s chief diplomat.\nIn dozens of interviews, Powell has dismissed questions about his plans by saying with a smile, \"I serve at the pleasure of the president.\"\nPowell has long been considered to be a one-term secretary of state, irrespective of whether Bush was re-elected. Speculation has been rife for months about possible successors in a second Bush term. Among those mentioned are national security adviser Condoleezza Rice (search) and U.N. Ambassador John Danforth (search).\nLast July, Bush suggested during an appearance in Philadelphia that he would be happy if Powell were to remain on. The remark went virtually unnoticed by the media but caught the attention of Powell aides.\nDuring a September interview with The Associated Press, Powell was asked whether he considered Bush&apos;s comment to be an invitation for him to stay on.\n\"Time will tell. We will see,\" Powell replied.\nWhen asked Wednesday about Powell&apos;s plans, his spokesman, Richard Boucher, reverted to the usual language about \"serving at the pleasure of the president.\"\nOne possibility would be for Powell to stay on for a brief period until after the national elections in Iraq, which are supposed to be held before the end of January 2005.\nAs analysts see it, a post-Iraq election departure for Powell would make more sense than one that could occur just days before the balloting in Iraq but after Bush&apos;s second term begins.\nAt a minimum, Bush&apos;s re-election means a series of foreign trips Powell plans will take on a more serious cast than they would have if Sen. John Kerry had prevailed Tuesday.\nAnd the Bush victory means that his own trip to an Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Chile before Thanksgiving will involve substantive exchanges rather than farewell handshakes and polite banter.\nThe 20 or so Asia-Pacific leaders invited there will be eager to hear what Bush has in mind for the region in his second term.\nFor his part, Powell will travel to Mexico on Monday for an overnight visit. The following week, he plans to spend four days in Chile as part of the U.S. summit entourage. He then will fly to Egypt for a major international conference on Iraq&apos;s future, a meeting Powell hopes to use to expand international cooperation for Iraq.\nHe also will attend a NATO meeting in Brussels in December and possibly meetings of other trans-Atlantic groups in Europe. In addition, Powell will attend a meeting in Morocco next month to push the Bush administration&apos;s pro-democracy agenda for Arab countries.\nIn the coming days, Powell will be boning up on issues involving Mexico ahead of his Monday visit. Mexican officials will be eager to hear more about Bush&apos;s proposal to provide legal status \u2014 at least on a temporary basis \u2014 for millions of undocumented aliens in the United States. Mexico is the principal source of such migrants.\nRenewable three-year work permits would be available for them if they can prove that they have a job and meet other criteria. Mexico strongly supports the initiative.\nBush proposed it last January but little has been heard about it since.\nIf Congress approves, officials say the new rules will make America safer by helping for the first time to document migrants who have no legal standing in the United States.",

He has said that the time has come to focus on border security as a way to make Mexico&apos;s southern border more secure and the United States more secure.\nPowell also is likely to point out that the time has finally come to resolve the border questions that have shut down congressional debate for years. He likely will say that the lack of clear answers has given Mexico&apos;s drug cartels a ready playground across most of the 2,000-mile border between the two nations. He is likely to tell the Mexicans that if they want their own law and order, America has felt compelled to provide a considerable degree of aid.\n\"It&apos;s time to create some order over there,\" he&apos;s likely to say, according to one U.S. official briefed on the possible talks.\nBush has talked about creating a comprehensive Southern border security strategy to tighten controls and border security, and the administration has pressed for billions of dollars in new money to fortify U.S. border defenses.\nSome analysts believe such border questions should be raised at the time of the meeting with Mexico's President Vicente Fox (search), but the administration has said only that security would come up at some point.\nPowell&apos;s meetings will be his last as a full member of Bush&apos;s cabinet. He will operate in an expanded capacity after his departure as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but it is unclear whether that role would continue.\nBush has said he wants to keep him on.

Have you ever played one that helped you understand a serious global problem?\nThis year, a United Nations program devoted to urban planning in countries affected by poverty or natural disasters began developing a sports field in the slums of Kibera, Kenya, designing it in the popular sandbox video game Minecraft. The game, which allows players to build entire worlds out of cubes in a 3-D environment, helped the project leaders create a visual representation of the field that could be easily understood by the neighborhood\u2019s residents.\nThe project, known as Block by Block, is among the highlights this week at the Games for Change Festival in New York, an annual event that promotes video games that seek social change. These efforts \u2014 known as serious games \u2014 once focused on education, to entice students to learn through digital play. But attention has shifted to more ambitious efforts like Block by Block, and a large part of that push has come from Games for Change, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that has worked with Google, NASA, the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation and TEDx.\nOne speaker at this year\u2019s festival is Zoran Popovic, the director of the Center for Game Science at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He led the team of researchers responsible for the puzzle game Foldit, which sought to crowdsource a solution to a scientific problem. Foldit asked players to take on the role of a biochemist and map out how proteins might be folded in nature. The game provided scores based on how well they performed. Three papers in the journal Nature have been published, based on Foldit discoveries, since the game\u2019s release in 2008; the most famous, in 2011, explained how Foldit players had helped to decipher the structure of an AIDS-related enzyme, a problem that scientists had been trying to solve for years.\nMr. Popovic plans to unveil a new project this week, a synthetic-biology game called NanoCrafter, whose goal is to discover molecular structures that could benefit vaccine and cancer research.\n\u2014 What are your favorite video games? What games did you play when you were younger? Looking back, what do you think they taught you \u2014 whether physical or mental skills or something more intangible? How have they enriched your life?\n\u2014 Have you ever played a video game like the ones at Games for Change, in which the goal is \u201cmore than entertainment\u201d? What did you think of it? What did you learn?\n\u2014 Do you think video games can be effective tools for learning? Do you think playing them might actually help \u201cchange the world\u201d? Why or why not?\n\u2014 If your school were to invest in a \u201cvideo game for change\u201d that was, like the examples in this article, fun to play, intellectually enriching and altruistically focused, what would you like it to be about? How might it work?\nHonestly I have never really played video games before, well I have but not as much as an average teen. But that little that I did play I just learned little strategies and the games really made you think. But they are really not that productive.\nI used to play games a lot but i have slowed down playing them now. I actually have learnt a lot of things from certain video games like strategies, and my friend said that he learnt that rubber comes from trees.\nI think integrating games into school could be a good idea. It would probably be executed poorly in most areas though. There\u2019s a stigma against video games in general that label all games as bad for your brain and they make you do bad things.\nMy favorite video game has to be guitar hero. I think this game has taught me how to multitask with my hands. I think video games are very good and can help inspire social change, depending on the type of game. No, I have never played a video game that has helped inspire me to change a serious global problem.\nI don\u2019t like to play video games. I rather do something else than be in four hours play games that not be educated.\nthe video games i have played are strategic and would make me think. i have never played a video game that benefits a cause before so i would go with some of the concepts listed in the article when deciding on one for my school to invest in.\nThat\u2019s actually really interesting concept because most games are like what you guys said, fps and the like. there are a handful of games that are different or promote learning. i personally have not heard anything that could help with research.\nMy favorite video games are the grand theft auto video games. Not just because of the violence but also because I don\u2019t play very many video games and it\u2019s fun to just drive around and wander the game. When I was younger my favorite video game was a hand held analog stick with a few different games on it including PAC man. I don\u2019t believe that playing these types of video games benefits you much. I\u2019ve never played a more than entertainment goal game. But I think it\u2019s a very intriguing idea, especially scenes so many kids learn from their surroundings and technology now days.\nMy favorite video games are Minecraft, COD, Counterstrike Source, Guitar Hero, Farcry, and Rainbow six. Looking back at these games I have learned a little more about weaponry, and playing video games has also helped with my hand-eye corrdination. I also think playing video games can help increase your reflexes and response time. When I started playing Minecraft I immediately fell In love because it allowed me to use my creativity and build things that I\u2019ve always wanted to build. I think video games can be a very effective tool for learning because it makes learning fun. But I also think that it should be taken in moderation and staring a screen all day isn\u2019t that great for you and neither is sitting all day. The more interactive learning is the better it will be in general. I think that bringing video games into schools could be a good way to bring more interaction to learning.\nMy number one game is World of tanks. when i was younger, i played minecraft. I was a 4 year minecraft player.. Minecraft gave me inspiration. But when i got World of tanks, i quit minecraft. World of tanks has taught me alot. Ive learned alot since i started playing. No blood, no gore. Just fun with big metal machines.\nI don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t play video games.\nWell i have not learned a lot because i don\u2019t play a lot. It shows that there is violence in the world. Also how to help you shoot more acculturate. I think that if schools had games then more people could enjoy and relax more.\nI have played some games that teaches you life lessons and some games that inspires you. Video games nowadays have little education to offer for you if you are playing modern consoles.\nThe way i learned to play video games is that most people can easily play any game if they put their mind into it. i play video games every single day and beat every single game there is its just what i like to do everyday when i get home from school etc. i can play really hard games that not everyone can beat i\u2019m technically the best at playing horror games and war games plus games like assasins creed 1 to throughout all the other assasin creed games. i am such a video game expert i\u2019ve played every system that ever came out from the beginning of atari to all of todays games. i just love to play video games.\nI love playing video games with my brothers. I play Black Ops, Mine Craft, Kinect Sports and more. Playing these games explain more than moving your thumbs it showed you how to multitask and some of the video games keeps you physically active when you have a X-Box 360.\nIm a senior in High School. Im always playing video games whenever im not either at school, work, or golf. I love video games and I feel that they are a quintessential part of learning. I have played almost every game. Games like pokemon help you to solve problems. Games like portal cause you to use physics and puzzles to play the game. Games like the bioshock series or the half life series create stories, that in my opinion, are better than reading book because you get to experience it. Even games like Call of duty increases reflexes.\n\u2013 My favourite video games are Deus Ex, The Witcher 2 and Half-Life 2.\nAs someone who lives in germany, where most students don\u2019t speak english very good. I think video games taught me a lot about english. It was the only subject I NEVER had problems with. From the first day on I was too good for my grade.\n\u2013 I honestly have never played one of those games, but after this article I\u2019m definitely looking forward to them.\n\u2013 I don\u2019t know, maybe about subjects, that are boring and complicated for many students, like biology and chemistry? I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to come up with an idea, but smart people, probably would.\nI play a lot of RPGs mostly. They are some of my favorite games. Most RPGs give you choices, and what choices you make affects the people, and world around you. Usually the choices range from good, to neutral, to evil. This is very similar to how life really is. The choices we make, whether they are good or bad, have a bigger impact on the world around us than we may think.\nmy favorite video games are games like Portal and Persona, games that actually require thinking while playing and not just mindless button mashing, the thing i think they\u2019ve taught me\u2026 that no matter who you are you can always be a hero if you put your mind to it!\nUnfortunately not, i would love to have the chance to be able to though, i believe that video games are more than just a way to distract ourselves or have a good time, i believe that the educational value of video games are much greater than what people believe.\nYes, video games are tools, whether the tool is used for entertainment or for education, it\u2019s full potential cannot be realized unless someone steps forward and says \u201clets try to use it like this!\u201d and works hard on that.\nI would like that many possibilities for interactive learning would open up, these interactive lessons would not only increase the amount of fun in a classroom, but also the amount of passion from students who can honestly say that the lessons spoke to them.\n@Alondra The correct sentence would be: I don\u2019t like to play video games. I Would rather do something else than playing four hours of video games that do not help with my education.\nI have played video games for years. All to often my choices were challenged or denied by my parents. At first I couldn\u2019t comprehend the difference or what were the deciding factors for their answer. As I\u2019ve grown older I see know how video games have the power to shape one\u2019s personality. Even in video games there are choices to be made, altruistic choices that can benefit another individual in the game or choices to eliminate your opponent. The choices are made in real life all to often and it\u2019s vital that children and teenagers recognized the value or consequences of the choices even within the games.\nI am impressed by the idea of Games for Change. If our school were to invest in such a game perhaps one that affords students the opportunity to understand how closely connected their games choices are to real life. A game that teaches altruistic behavior and choices while still having fun. We find a significant change and positive growth in our society through future generations.\nThe focus of the some games is to build what ever the mind can imagine. I think that games can be more than entertainment because it makes you think about things that you may have see in your life. It also could make you think of real building and structure around the world. Others games can make you think about real life world problems and make you aware that they are happening. They may also help influence what you do later in your life. Overall I think that some games can do more than just entertainment and can make you think about real things and ideas.",
    "wm_text": " games with my brothers has taught me how to be more patient and focused. It\u2019s also taught me how to talk to people.\nMy favorite game of all time is Call of Duty 2. I love the story line. No one was ever as good at the story line in multiplayer than CoD 2\u2019s story line. I love playing games and gaining more experience and to meet people who are really good at video games. I learned a lot about the game. It helped me hone my skills. I felt really good about myself after playing a video game and getting good. I really think that gamers who are really good at video games can help with social change. I think that the games they play are about violence and killing people. I really like the realistic games. The games that take place in the real world help you learn more about other cultures. I think it\u2019s really good for kids. I really like Call of Duty 2, and Black Ops 2, and the more textured games I play in school. I really like CoD 2\u2019s story line. I love to play games, and it\u2019s really good, because it teaches you how to attack people and defend. I really like COD\u2019s campaigns. I think that if games can help you learn, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve personally never been interested in the games that Games for Change gives out. I don\u2019t do video games, because it\u2019s violent. I don\u2019t agree with it. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re great for education. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re entertaining. I think if people don\u2019t do violent games, they\u2019ll be more aggressive, the same way if they made movies about bad things that happened. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re right. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good",

Just Dance 3.\nI think that they would be incredible they could be a great way to learn. I mean I play a game called The Sims where you have to learn how to live life in a virtual world. So yeah if they added that to the real world it would be a good learning tool.\nI think video games can be a useful tool for learning. I mean, who hasn\u2019t entertained themselves when they were bored in school?

    "text": "It's not always easy to keep mentally focused during running. Focus requires discipline and a certain level of mental toughness, meaning that you have developed the capacity to perform to the best of your ability despite external conditions or internal distractions. You can minimize distractions and help yourself stay focused by implementing self-help techniques and maintaining a positive, nonjudgmental attitude.\nMentally tough athletes push through and overcome obstacles to stay focused on their ultimate goal. Developing the traits that characterize mental toughness can help you remain focused during running. According to sports psychologist JoAnn Dahlkoetter in an article for the online runner's resource, \"Competitor,\" several characteristics or traits tare commonly identified in mentally tough runners: Resilience, focus, strength, preparation, vision, openness and trust. You simply do not allow yourself to become distracted by external conditions or internal emotions -- you have the ability to put these distractions behind you for the time being and live in the moment.\nPositive self-talk can encourage you and help you stay focused while running. According to sports psychologists Leif Smith and Todd Kays in \"Sports Psychology for Dummies,\" mentally repeating specific cue words, such as \"focus\" or \"hustle,\" may help to increase your concentration when you feel a decrease in your level of focus. Tape the cue words to a piece of athletic tape around your wrist and mentally concentrate on them while you run, as though the words are your mantra. Don't beat yourself up if you're having an off day. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a good friend. Be positive and encouraging and tell yourself that you can do it.\nWhen you feel yourself starting to tire or slow down, marathon runner and trainer Jeff Galloway suggests practicing the following drill, adapted from his book, \"Mental Training for Runners: How to Stay Motivated.\" Tell yourself that you're going to continue running for just one minute more, reducing your pace slightly for a few seconds, then continue this pattern, telling yourself \"one more minute\" or \"10 more steps\" until you achieve your goal for the day. If you break down your goal into small chunks, it may seem more manageable and achievable and you'll be less likely to lose focus.\nAlmost all athletes use some form of visualization prior to or during their workout or competition to help them stay focused. According to Galloway, worrying and focusing on the negative possibilities is a major way that many runners become distracted and lose motivation. Visualization can help you overcome your worries and direct your focus back to your goal. Visualization involves vividly imagining and rehearsing positive outcomes to future events or the event in which you're currently involved. Before your race, you might lie down and imagine yourself running effortlessly, overcoming obstacles and achieving your goal. The more vividly you can imagine the scene by involving all of your five senses, the more effective your visualization will be.",
    "wm_text": " If you are having trouble falling asleep, use your visualization training to help you drift off.\nYou can help yourself stay focused by maintaining a good, positive mind-set. When negative thoughts or anxious feelings arise in your mind, try and replace them with more positive ones. Focus on your breathing, which can help ease you into a meditative state. If this technique doesn't work, try and remain calm, trying to focus your thoughts and emotions on a task or goal that brings you joy, such as running with a friend or running to raise money for a charity.\nMany runners find that the key to maintaining a positive mind-set is to avoid even thinking negative thoughts. Once they arise in your mind, try and replace them with more positive, helpful thoughts, or even try and actively avoid them. When you are having trouble focusing, find something to focus on, whether it's another runner, a bird flying overhead or a flag strung neatly across the road. When running with a friend or training for a race, make sure to keep talking about positive or motivational things that will help you stay motivated to keep running when you'd rather not be on your feet, or stop if you have to. Remind yourself that the time you are training now will help you reap benefits later in life, such as improved self-esteem or confidence in dealing with emergencies. Remind yourself that this is something that you are doing for yourself.\nIt's important to keep your mind-set positive, because it will affect your running in the same way that your physical fitness affects your running. A negative mind-set will affect you in many ways, not only in how you run but also how serious you are about your running endeavors. You may start off running with the right motivation, but if your mind-set is negative or tired by the time you reach your run, that motivation may just vanish and you may even become frustrated. By keeping your mind-set positive, you are more likely",

    "no_wm_text": "\n\nNot only do you need to focus your mind during running, you also need to keep your body focused on the athlete in front of you, says sports psychologist John Rosenthal in his book, \"Sports Psychology for Dummies.\" For runners who start to feel anxious or lose focus, Rosenthal recommends focusing on the person in front of you instead of the distance between you and them. For example, if you're on a trail race and you're feeling anxious because you're unsure of your ability to finish the race, focus on the person running ahead of you. Their pace and stride will help you maintain your focus.\nMental toughness is a quality that you can cultivate. Mental toughness involves developing and maintaining a growth mindset, which involves having a positive attitude and the belief that you can improve your performance. You don't need to be perfect or 100 percent prepared to run effectively, and it's OK to learn from mistakes and try new techniques along the way.\nIt's easier to accomplish your goals if you don't worry about them in the first place. Stop worrying about when your marathon will be and just go for it. Don't focus on the daunting amount of work, the possible lack of time in your schedule and the long days of training ahead of you. Just start. Then, you'll develop your mental toughness.\n\nComments\n\nSimply Irresistible\n\nTaking a page out of those girls you went to high school with who can't stop smugly posting every detail of their perfect lives on Facebook, Lady Gaga shaded America's youngest grandma Taylor Swift just perfectly on Twitter yesterday.

Opara says he isn't quite so sure.\nBut a long injury history \u2014 and a look toward life after soccer \u2014 made it more than just a hasty reaction. He played only three games in 2014 before suffering a rare chondral defect in his right ankle.\n\"I've been through a lot with all the other injuries,\" he said. \"I wanted to be healthy for my life.\n\"And I felt like I couldn't catch a break. It was like, this again? I just wondered if it would be worth it to go through all that all over again.\"\nOpara spoke with his family and friends. He told them he was contemplating retirement \u2014 only two months after his 26th birthday and only days after national experts put him in the conversation for Major League Soccer's best defender.\nThen? A change of heart.\nIt came slowly. After undergoing a minimally-invasive surgery \u2014 a recently-developed procedure designed to expedite his return to the field \u2014 Opara learned his season wasn't over just yet. Doctors allowed for the possibility of a 2015 return. Maybe.\nA possibility is all he needed. He began rehab in the following weeks. The pain subsided more quickly than he expected. He regained the urge to join his teammates back on the field.\nAnd that's looking more and more likely by the day. Opara has returned to Sporting Kansas City practice, at least for the non-contact drills, with an eye toward returning to the field this season. His coach, Peter Vermes, expects it to happen \u2014 whether it be before the regular season concludes on Oct. 25 or sometime during the playoffs.\n\"That's always been the goal (since the diagnosis),\" Opara said. \"Obviously the way I've been progressing, for now, why not try to push and see where it goes? If we keep doing well as a team and hopefully make the playoffs and make a deep run, I see no reason why I wouldn't be available for that.\"\nThere are still hurdles to cross, of course. While Opara says his lateral movement is \"just as good, if not better\" than it was prior to the Achilles' tendon rupture, the linear movements are still a work in progress. He is noted for his athleticism \u2014 which makes him a dangerous aerial weapon \u2014 but his jumping ability hasn't fully returned yet.\nThere are signs it's close.\n\"Ike was in an exercise the other day. If you would've come out here and you didn't know the team, and I (told) you to pick that guy that you think is injured out there, you would never pick him,\" Vermes said. \"I can tell you that.\"\nEven so, Opara isn't near 90-minutes fit. And central defender isn't a typical spot for a mid-gme substitution, though Vermes hinted at an exception.\n\"One of the things you can do with Ike is bring him on late in the game, and he can be an extra guy for aerial duels and things like that,\" Vermes said. \"He has value in that respect.\"\nIt's an exciting possibility \u2014 and a potentially significant one for a Sporting KC team in need of an added aerial threat on offensive set pieces.\n\"I don't know what my future holds. I'm just taking it day-by-day,\" Opara said. \"But it looks a lot better than it did a few months ago. I know that.\"",

    "text": "Under intense pressure to improve conditions in the jail complex on Rikers Island, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio has developed a plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds to a dedicated jail for youths in the Bronx.\nThe cost to carry out the plan is expected to be about $300 million, officials said.\nThe plan calls for the city to reconfigure the Horizon Juvenile Center, which is currently used to hold 14- and 15-year olds, to house the 16- and 17-year olds who are typically sent to Rikers.\nA 2015 settlement with the Department of Justice on reform at Rikers called on the city to seek an alternative location to house inmates under 18, although it stopped short of requiring it.\nNew York is the only state other than North Carolina that prosecutes all children 16 and older as adults if they are accused of a crime. In New York City, they are likely to wind up at Rikers, a notoriously brutal lockup. There are currently about 200 inmates who are 16 or 17 at Rikers, down from about 330 in 2013.\nThe city and many advocates have urged state lawmakers to pass a law that would treat those under the age of 18 as juveniles, but the proposal has gone nowhere in Albany.\nThe new plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds from Rikers must overcome several hurdles. It has to be approved through the city\u2019s time-consuming land use process: The local community board and the Bronx borough president get to weigh in and it must be approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council.\nBut the change will not happen any time soon; officials said it could take four years or more to get approvals and to complete construction. The plan also calls for the city to remodel another juvenile detention site, the Crossroads Juvenile Center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to hold all of the city\u2019s 14- and 15-year-old detainees, including those who had previously gone to Horizon.\nThe cost of refurbishing the Bronx center is budgeted at $170 million. The cost of remodeling the Brooklyn center is budgeted at $129 million.\nAdvocates supported the move but lamented the long delay before the new center will be ready, assuming that it survives the land-use review process.\n\u201cFor us this is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d he said.\nMore than 95 percent of the 16- and 17-year-olds at Rikers are awaiting trial. More than a third have been charged with robbery and about one in 10 have been charged with assault, according to data provided by the city.\nIncreased attention was focused on the plight of younger teenagers at Rikers in 2014 after The New Yorker published an article about Kalief Browder, who was sent there at 16, accused of stealing a backpack. He never stood trial or was found guilty of any crime but he spent three years at Rikers, nearly two of them in solitary confinement. He told of being beaten repeatedly by guards and other inmates and trying several times to kill himself while in custody. After his release he remained deeply troubled by the experience and he committed suicide last year at age 22.\nThe city ended solitary confinement for Rikers inmates under 18 in December 2014.",
    "wm_text": "\nCity officials said that the current plan, which is still being studied, would not end the use of solitary confinement for 16- and17-year olds.\nPaul Prestia, the chief of the juvenile division of the chief of staff to the chief of the Department of Correction, said that the current system \u201chas led to tremendous violence,\u201d resulting in 60 stabbings and 275 fights over the past 12 months. He said that the current system also results in youths entering the system too often and going through the criminal justice system more than a dozen times.\n\u201cRemoving them from the borough where they grew up is going to make it less likely that they come back and it is going to make it less likely that they re-offend,\u201d Prestia said.\nHe said that the idea of having youths in the Bronx or Brooklyn who are 16 or 17 prosecuted as adults would make it less likely that they felt compelled to re-offend as adults or make it less likely that they would make it to the criminal justice system.\n\u201cIf you prove your point as a kid you go through the system less frequently,\u201d Prestia said.\nNicole Serriteno, the commissioner of adult supervision at the Bureau of Adult Probation and Parole, said that the report of the murder of Jharrel Jerome at Horizon last year showed that the system had problems as it dealt with those 16 or 17 who are being held there.\n\u201cThis is one issue that came to the forefront and it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish we had thought about it in the past. The city has done an incredible amount to address programs, but we need to think differently.\u201d\nThe plan, which is the result of a two-year study by a task force that was created by the Department of Correction and the Juvenile Center Oversight Alliance, also calls for more youth-oriented programming",

Following is a look at the path Round 2 could take, based on interviews with participants on both sides.\nQ: Can you remind me what's at stake?\nA: After a bitter clash and just a week before a New Year's Day deadline, President Barack Obama and Congress renewed a 2 percentage point payroll tax cut for 160 million workers and benefits for the long-term unemployed through February. They also temporarily forestalled a deep cut in doctors' Medicare fees that threatened to make it harder for the elderly to find physicians who would treat them. Now, the two sides need to figure out how to extend all three measures through 2012 and cover the roughly $160 billion cost.\nQ: Are they expected to succeed?\nA: Yes, though it will probably take until shortly before the current extensions expire Feb. 29. There are complicated decisions ahead, chiefly what programs to cut and what fees to increase to offset the price tag. Just as important, Democrats won't be in a hurry to finish.\nA: Republicans took a severe pounding in December when the House GOP resisted a bipartisan, Senate-approved, two-month extension of the payroll tax cut, which was designed to give lawmakers time to negotiate a longer version. With control of the White House and Congress at stake in the November elections, many Democrats think the GOP could incur further damage if these latest talks take time.\nMany Republicans doubt the economic benefit of a payroll tax cut, a foundation of Obama's plan to create jobs. But as December's battle unfolded, GOP leaders worried that they would suffer political damage from opposing the deeply popular tax cut, worth $1,000 annually to a family earning $50,000 a year.\nWith the House's fractious conservative wing balking until the very end, the fight made the GOP look like it was opposing the tax reduction -- which Democrats contrasted with Republican support for tax breaks for the wealthy. Most Republicans want this year's fight to end quickly so they can change the subject to their own efforts to cut taxes, federal spending and Obama administration regulations.\nQ: How long can Democrats prolong the negotiations?\nA: If they're not careful they could overplay their hand.\nDemocrats scored points last year by forcing Senate votes on their proposal to finance the payroll tax cut with a small surtax on people earning $1 million or more a year. They have a new incentive to do something similar this year with the GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, a wealthy venture capitalist, being cast by party rivals as callous and out of touch.\nAs a result, many Democrats want to begin this year's talks on extending the Social Security tax cut by targeting the wealthy for a tax increase, perhaps with the millionaire surtax or by limiting their deductions. The millionaire surtax has no chance of passage in the GOP-run House, and Democrats could be accused of blatantly playing politics. Democrats and Obama have a reason to cut a deal: They believe extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits will goose the economy and reduce the risk of another economic downturn that could hurt their election prospects.\nQ; What will the 20 members of Congress do?\nA: House and Senate party leaders each have appointed bargainers to hash out differences over the bill, following Congress' tradition of naming conference committees to craft compromise legislation. But as usual when high-profile battles are being resolved, party leaders will have tight control over the ultimate deal. Still, conference committee members will play a role in writing details, and their endorsement of a package would let leaders argue that they didn't jam something down the throats of rank-and-file lawmakers.\nQ: Who are these 20 lawmakers?\nA: They range from formidable committee chairmen to lowly freshmen, but each has a stake in the fight.\nThe chairmen of Congress' two tax-writing committees are included: Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., of the Senate Finance Committee.\nSen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., is the Senate's No. 2 Republican and a close ally of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, facing re-election this fall in the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, has repeatedly been given a visible role in the payroll tax fight by party leaders.\nRep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., a party leader, should be a leading opponent of Republican proposals to help finance the plan by effectively denying the child tax credit to many illegal immigrants. Freshman GOP Rep. Nan Hayworth is from a closely contested district in New York's Hudson River Valley.\nHayworth and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., are doctors, which could give them roles in the talks involving Medicare. A pair of Maryland Democrats, Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, are sure to battle a Republican proposal to make federal employees contribute more to their pensions.\nQ: Do they bring other experience to the bargaining table?\nA: Seven have participated in recent, failed bipartisan efforts to contain mammoth budget deficits. Those were Congress' supercommittee, talks led by Vice President Joe Biden, the \"Group of Six\" senators, and a presidential commission headed by former Wyoming GOP Sen. Alan Simpson and former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, Erskine Bowles.\nNone of those groups succeeded, largely because party leaders could not agree to the controversial tax increases and cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare that would have been required for the trillions of dollars in savings needed.\nFar smaller savings are needed to resolve the payroll tax fight, and the consensus is that this time, the president and leaders in both parties want a package that can become law.",
    "wm_text": "\nSo lawmakers likely will head into the talks seeking broad, bipartisan agreements like the 2010 Simpson-Bowles deal on deficit reduction.\nQ: Will there be any bipartisan agreements among the negotiators?\nA: All of the eyes will be on the chief Democratic and Republican negotiators, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. The full Senate voted overwhelmingly to keep the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits in place, 80-18. With few votes to spare, it's up to Reid and Boehner to craft a bipartisan compromise.\nTheir parties are so divided that the two men could find that they've been dragged to the opposite extremes of the ideological spectrum.\nBoehner is a fiscal conservative who says the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits should not be extended without major new spending cuts or tax increases. He is likely to oppose a surtax or other tax hikes on millionaires.\nReid has felt compelled to salvage the payroll tax cut and benefits for more than 4 million jobless workers since the Senate was unable to pass his Senate-approved, two-month extension of the provisions. He's a dyed-in-the-wool liberal whose party has long supported higher taxes on people like Romney, who made his fortune in private equity. If anything, Reid's already been viewed by some liberals as overly eager to help Republicans negotiate away Obama's health care law in an attempt to bring the payroll tax debate to a close soon.",

    "no_wm_text": "\nSo lawmakers likely will be searching for ways to avoid the kind of impasse that has characterizes so many prior deficit-reduction efforts.\nQ: What's the biggest sticking point?\nA: All sides are hoping for a way to finance the payroll tax cut and unemployed benefits for workers who make less than $110,100 annually -- but not at the same time. Republicans are demanding to delay the tax cut for two months, while Democrats want to extend the benefit for a full year.\nNo matter what compromise emerges, it's likely to be opposed by at least one of the three groups that may be most important to its success.\nHouse Republicans likely won't approve any plan that involves taxing the wealthy. Minority Leader Pelosi, D-Calif., has vowed that most Democrats won't vote for a deal that doesn't include restoring the full payroll tax cut, and she says she wants the Democratic conference to vote on a final plan before it comes to the House floor for a vote.\nSenate Democrats -- who initially wanted a two-year extension of all three measures -- will demand that any plan to replace the expired tax cut for workers with 2.1 million or more dependents also extend jobless benefits for long-term unemployed workers.\nMany Democrats and Republicans think it would be politically smart to reach a long-term agreement to extend both the Social Security payroll tax cut and jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed, a group of about 2.6 million people. But it's likely to be difficult to reach a deal on long-term unemployment benefits that breaks sharply with the political mood in both parties.\nEconomists say that is because the relief payments provided to those jobless workers have prevented them from turning to the welfare system, and because enhanced unemployment payments have helped lift the unemployment rate to a four-year low of 8.3 percent.\nQ: What would happen if the talks collapse again?\nA: That's hard to predict.\nCongress",

    "text": "WASHINGTON - WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal regulators voted Wednesday to require companies to reveal more information about how they pay their executives amid a public outcry over compensation.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4-to-1 to expand the disclosure requirements for public companies.\nCompany policies that encouraged excessive risk-taking and rewarded executives for delivering short-term profits were blamed for fueling the financial crisis.\nThe SEC also changed a formula that critics say allowed companies to understate how much their senior executives are paid. At issue is how public companies report stock options and stock awards in regulatory filings. Such awards often make up most of top executives' pay.\nThe new requirements include information on how a company's pay policies might encourage too much risk-taking.\nSeparately, the agency voted unanimously to require thousands of investment advisers who have custody of clients' money to submit to annual surprise exams by outside auditors.\nThe surprise audits would allow independent accountants to review the books and verify that the money is there. The snap audits would apply to about 1,600 investment advisers that don't use third-party custodians, out of roughly 11,000 advisers registered with the SEC.\nThis move is aimed at plugging gaps that allowed disgraced money manager Bernard Madoff to deceive investors.\nThe expanded executive pay disclosure rules will take effect next spring, when companies send annual proxy disclosures to shareholders.\nThe changes will help investors make better-informed voting decisions for the companies in which they hold stock, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said.\n\"By adopting these rules, we will improve the disclosure around risk, compensation and corporate governance, thereby increasing accountability and directly benefiting investors,\" Schapiro said before the vote.\nBut Commissioner Kathleen Casey said she opposed some of the new requirements, such as added information on qualifications of directors and candidates for the board, that she said could be \"unduly burdensome.\"\nAs a result, Casey said she was voting against the rule as a whole.\nIt was the first final rule adopted by the SEC this year under Schapiro's tenure. Numerous proposals have been made by the commissioners.\n\u2014Legal actions involving the company's executive officers, directors and nominees for the board.\n\u2014The role played by diversity as a factor in choosing candidates for the board.\n\u2014Potential conflicts of interest on the part of compensation consultants retained by the company.\nThe Obama administration imposed pay curbs on banks that received federal bailout money. Since then, eight of the largest such banks have either repaid or said they will repay their federal money, largely to escape caps on executive pay.\nThe Federal Reserve has set a February deadline for the 28 biggest U.S. banks \u2014 including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. \u2014 for submitting 2010 compensation plans. The Fed also will be encouraging, though not requiring, banks to revise this year's pay plans if they are out of step with principles the Fed has proposed to limit risk.\nAnger over lavish Wall Street pay has led some U.S. banks to take pre-emptive action. Goldman Sachs, for example, has said it won't give cash bonuses to 30 top executives. Instead, the bonuses will be paid in stock that can't be cashed in for five years.\nCompanies will have to disclose how pay is determined in departments involved in the riskiest activities \u2014 or departments that produce a big chunk of company profits.\nThe new requirements were proposed by the SEC and opened to public comment in July. They build on rules the agency adopted in 2006.\nUnder current rules, companies don't have to reveal the full value of stock options they give an executive. Instead, they must disclose in their annual proxy statements only the portion of an options award that vests that year.\nThe new rule will require companies to show in a summary table the estimated value of all stock-based awards on the day they are granted. The SEC's 2006 rules had relegated those totals to a separate table that investors often overlook or find hard to decipher.\nAn example is the case of a company that decides its CEO deserves $10 million worth of stock options, to vest in equal installments over four years. Under current rules, the company would have to include only $2.5 million \u2014 one-fourth of the total of the $10 million total \u2014 in the summary table.",
    "wm_text": "\nUnder the new proposal, that company would be required to include $3 million, or $1 million per year in stock awards. The company would still consider the CEO's pay in its proxy statements and calculate the compensation using the same formulas it used before the changes. The details of the CEO's pay would be disclosed in the proxy statements.\nCritics complained that the new requirements were unnecessary to meet the spirit of the SEC's 2006 rule. The board of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a lobbying group for brokerages, said the changes would make it harder for shareholders to compare compensation at different companies.\n\"In this day and age of the Internet and mobile devices, it's no longer sufficient for an executive compensation disclosure to be posted on a corporate website and a shareholder to have to review dozens of such documents to come up with relevant comparative information to help make decisions about compensation,\" SIFMA's executive vice president and general counsel, Sarah E. Hall, said in a letter to the SEC.\nRetail investors would be affected the most, said James Angel, a University of Maryland management professor who studies executive compensation. He noted that the bulk of corporate stock is owned by institutions that have stock analysts and models that could help them determine the value of the options.\n\"But if an individual has no experience with options and no knowledge, then they need to be more informed,\" Angel said. \"More information is good.\"\nBy David Porter, Associated Press",

    "no_wm_text": "\nUnder the new rule, companies will have to disclose the full value of the stock options as well as the value of other awards on the day of grant.\nPaul Rosenthal, a professor at the University of Michigan law school, said the new disclosures could lead to changes in pay practices.\n\"Companies will want to keep the average value of the vesting of stock options low so as to avoid the embarrassment of public disclosure,\" Rosenthal said. \"But if they do that, they will have to pay their executives less.\"\nCompanies also will have to disclose how they calculate compensation for their top executives and how much of it consists of cash.\nThere also will be a fresh requirement that companies disclose the executive they have given the biggest bonus in the most recent year.\nThe new rule, which is expected to cost companies an estimated $1 million a year to implement, comes amid growing public anger over how much executives make.\nEarlier this month, thousands of people marched in New York City to protest Wall Street bonuses. Organizers said more than 8,000 people rallied around noon on Wall Street and then walked to Times Square, where they posed for a photograph in front of the famous \"Charging Bull\" statue.\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has called for a federal tax on Wall Street compensation, similar to the one that exists for corporate profits, to help pay for more city services.\nSome companies have responded to the outcry by cutting executive pay or trying to dole out more of it in stock options, which are arguably less susceptible to public backlash.\nMany companies have been taking steps to try to improve corporate accountability and cut incentives for risk-taking.\nReferring to the new disclosure requirements, Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said the enhancements the SEC is proposing are long overdue.\n\"Hopefully, they will create a more sustained focus and attention to pay practices in the corporate world,\" Elson said.",

They received a $4,000 grant that helped them pay travel expenses to the Philippines to bring the children home.\nThough they had always had tossed around the idea of adoption, they were spurred to take action when their older son asked them about it a few years ago.\n\"He said, 'Hey. Can we adopt? I'd like to have a brother,\" Misty Mapes recalled.\nMisty Mapes, who works as a teacher, and Patrick, who is a dockworker, set about eliminating as many of their expenses as they could to save the $40,000 they would need to took to fund the adoption.\nThat final boost was provided by the Gift of Adoption Fund, which bridges the game when people are nearing the goal of completing the adoption, but need a little extra financial help to finalize it, said Marcy McKay, a La Grange resident and volunteer for the fund.\nThough they didn't need the financial help to adopt their children that the Gift of Adoption Fund provides, the McKays, who have three adopted children ages 14, 13, and 11, know how costly it is and are working to help other families adopt.\nIn November 2014, Bethany and Jared Crain got a call saying that they were matched with an expectant mother.\nWhile they were ecstatic that they could be adding to their family of three, they decided not to tell their 4-year-old that she could be getting a sibling.\n\"It's just so extremely expensive,\" said McKay. \"A lot of people don't have that kind of money.\"\nThe need on the part of children to have families is great, too. The fund estimates there are 140 million children around the world who are orphaned and 500,000 in the U.S. who are living in foster care and have no permanent family to call their own.\nThe goal of the fund is to inspire adoption by providing grants to qualified parents. Parents who seek grants are required to show that they have financial need and have already completed some of the steps needed to adopt such as working with a licensed agency and having a home study done.\nThe fund puts an emphasis on completing adoptions for children who may find it more difficult to be placed with a permanent family. Those children may be siblings, like Regina and Regino Mapes, children who are aging out, have medical needs or who may go into foster care.\nThe grants that are supplied by the nonprofit range from $3,500 to $7,500.\nJoan Schoon's desire to be a foster parent was born out of compassion and sympathy.\nAs a teenager, she remembers listening to her friends who were foster children complain about treatment they endured in some of their previous foster homes.\n\"They apply for the exact dollar amount they need and the grants are paid directly to the adoption agency,\" McKay said.\nThe fund was founded in 1996 by a couple who, like the McKays, felt thankful that they had the financial resources to pay for adopting children, and wanted to help other families who need the support, according to its website.\nShe said the group raises money through a variety of fundraisers such as cocktail parties and golf outings.\n\"It's such a compelling cause,\" said McKay, noting that many of their donations are in the $50 to $100 ranges.\n\"It's a perfect fit,\" she said.",

Video and other information on an opponent began flowing.\nBut the Wildcats will prepare differently this time. On top of adjusting to the approach of a new coaching staff, they will have to spend the next two days planning for multiple opponents before locking in on either La Salle or Boise State on Thursday in Kansas City.\nScouting for two teams instead of one will be a challenge. Coaches will come up with two game plans, and the staff will provide players with twice as much video. To help ease the process, Bruce Weber said four coaches will help gather information instead of the usual three.\nSome will argue preparing for multiple opponents puts K-State at a disadvantage compared to other highly seeded teams.

    "text": "The write-up \u201cDoctor had thyself\u201d (Spectrum, October 4) took up the issue of professional ethics among doctors. Once sacrosanct Hippocratic Oath has been obscured by the lure of lucre and commission culture.\nAll human concerns and considerations are at stake so much so that each patient is considered a milch-cow. But all this is antithetical to the concept of a welfare state. Healthcare matters more than anything else in India.\nThe government, intelligentsia, law enforcing agencies and charitable organisations must rise to the occasion and curb illegal and undesirable medical practices. The marketing of drugs should be strictly regulated and supervised. Justice should be prompt and deterrent.\nThe role of a doctor in society ought to be consoling, sustaining and elevating in order to revive the erstwhile cordial and courteous bonds in doctor patient relationship. Still a roaring practice laced with milk of human kindness, credibility and self-esteem will bring fame, prestige and money. Introspect deeply and act resolutely.\nVaranasi or Banaras (Spectrum, October 11) was one of the six flourishing places in the days of the Buddha. British resident, Jonathan Duncan established a Sanskrit college there in 1792. Mrs Annie Besant, an activist of the Theosophical Society started Central Hindu School in 1889, which eventually developed into the Banaras Hindu University in 1915.\nWhen the celebrated Vishvanath Temple in the city was demolished and a mosque was built there under the orders of Aurangzeb, poet Chandar Bhan satirically said: \u201cBa-been karaamat-e-butkhaana-e-mara ai Shaikh/Agar kharaab shavad khaana-e-khuda gardad\u201d (See the miracle of my temple. Even after its destruction it remains the abode of God).\nPeerless poet, Mirza Ghalib, visited Varanasi on December 1, 1827. He was so much enamoured with the place that he stayed there for about a month. In his poem Chiraag-e-dair (lamp of temple) he admired the city. It comprises 108 couplets, a lucky number for the Hindus. Their rosaries have 108 beads. The poet, who described Banaras as the Ka\u2019aba of Hindustan, says, a wise man told him that doomsday would not come, as God did not want the destruction of this elegant city.\nThe practice of giving English titles to Hindi movies (\u201cDesi movies English titles\u201d, Spectrum, Sept 27) is not new, as many movies have had English titles throughout the history of Indian cinema. First and foremost comes to mind films like Street Singer and President which had K.L. Saigal as hero. Mother India (1957) made by Mehboob is considered a landmark in Indian cinema.\nGuru Dutt and Madhubala came up with an evergreen musical comedy Mr & Mrs. 55. Raj Kapoor produced \u201cBoot Polish\u201d (1956) bringing out the struggles of street children. Another one was Love in Shimla (1959) which introduced Sadhana as a new face. Evergreen hero Dev Anand starred in many movies with English titles like Taxi Driver, House No. 44, Paying Guest, CID, Love Marriage, Gambler, Jewel Thief and above all his magnum opus Guide (1966).\nIn \u201cRoad to happiness\u201d (Saturday Extra, Sept. 12) the writer has beautifully enumerated eight points to achieve happiness, which has become a rare commodity in this materialistic and selfish world.\nI fully endorse his points. Nathaniel Cotton\u2019s verse, which the writer quoted to buttress his points, was full of wisdom, prudence, reason, sanity and practical knowledge.\nIt is said that sympathy is a heavenly quality and should be shown to everyone in trouble to attain happiness. Kindness, goodness and loving care of one\u2019s aged and ailing parents, contentment and peace of mind, the belief in \u201clive and let live\u201d, \u201clet bygones be bygones\u201d and practice of ahimsa (non-violence) are the key ingredients of happiness. Noble deeds, good food, good thoughts, good conduct devoid of envy, jealousy, rivalry, grudge, malice, back biting and ill-will lead to happiness. The recital of god\u2019s name acts as an icing on the cake.\nLife is a precious gift of God. It is worth living with all its frustrations, impediments and failures. Those who live it as it comes along can solve problems; overcome hardships to achieve their goals and happiness. One should work and not remain idle to be happy. Bad habits like drinking in excess, smoking, taking opium and other such vices should be shunned as these ruin one\u2019s happiness, home and hearth. Punctuality, the mark of civilisation and culture, must be cultivated to gain happiness.\nThinking about common good rather than about one\u2019s own self, caring more for one\u2019s duties than for rights and providing food, water and shelter to the have-nots can increase one\u2019s happiness manifold. To conclude: Happy is the man, whose wish and care, a few paternal acres bound, content to breathe his native air, in his own ground.",

    "text": "KARACHI: Driving up to Landhi you reach an area on the rather bumpy Mehran Highway where pick-ups and lorries number more than the other vehicles. Those coming in are empty but the ones driving out are loaded with dozens of silver milk canisters. Well, of course, why wouldn\u2019t they be? After all, this is Bhains Colony, the place the entire city gets its milk from.\nYou can pick up some moos coming from various directions. But there are hardly any cattle roaming about freely here or there. That\u2019s because they are all doing the work inside the dairy farms on either side of the road. The animals there eat and drink all day to stay healthy and be able to produce lots and lots of good quality milk.\n\u201cWe milk our buffaloes twice in 24 hours \u2014 at 4am and 4pm,\u201d says Imtiaz Ahmed, one of the staff supervisors at Shaukat Mukhtar Farms. There are some 450 buffaloes at the farm and almost all are lined up to enjoy their feed as the men milk them manually by hand.\n\u201cEating keeps them busy. So as they munch on their feed they stay in one place for us to be able to milk them,\u201d he says. To ensure that the dairy workers don\u2019t get kicked in the face by the buffaloes, they also lightly tie up their hind legs while milking them.\nAsked why they don\u2019t have pumps for milking, he explains that there are pumps too at several dairy farms in Bhains Colony, but at their farms they prefer to milk by hand. \u201cUsually, we use pumps to milk cows, not buffaloes. Cows give more milk, too. Pumps are good for milking in quantity. But cows\u2019 milk is thin while buffalo milk is thicker and richer,\u201d he explains.\nThe feed the animals eat has been specially designed and is highly nutritious to help them produce more milk. \u201cIt contains wheat, porridge, lentils, mustard, spinach greens, Malaysian palm oil, corn, ghee, etc,\u201d he says.\nThe dairy workers with stainless steel buckets and metal canisters bring over the milk they collect to pour into big metal tubs placed at various points. \u201cFresh milk is warm. Keeping it in big tubs helps it to cool slightly before sending it off to the market,\u201d shares Aslam Malik, another staff member at the farm. And he adds that the milk better reach the milk shops in a couple of hours otherwise it can go bad.\n\u201cThe shops have chillers and refrigerators to store it properly but we here only concentrate on the production part of it,\u201d he says, adding that the milk is absolutely pure at this point. \u201cForty litres of milk carries about 4kg of cream,\u201d he says gesturing to the layer of cream floating on top of the milk in the tubs. \u201cBut once this milk leaves this place, it will be tampered with and diluted according to the conscience of the people who are into this kind of dishonesty,\u201d he says.\nThe milk is sold for Rs70 per litre at the dairy farms and in the shops it is sold for Rs80 or 85 a litre.\n\u201cThe price was only increased earlier this month from the previous rate of Rs66 per litre,\u201d he says.\nThe dairy farmers say that everyone should have fresh milk instead of the packaged variety. \u201cWhat you get in the name of milk in a box is something devoid of the healthy fats, cream and nutrition. It is processed milk where they have taken away the fat for making side products such as cheese, butter, ghee, yogurt, lassi, etc,\u201d says Malik.\nThe dairy farmers buy new cattle every month to replace the ones that have finished their milking cycle and are considered spent. These could then be sent off to the slaughterhouse or to a farm where they can take a short break before insemination and parturition before lactating again.\nThe best cattle, the farmers say, are from Badin in Sindh and from the Ravi area in Punjab. These may cost between Rs160,000 to Rs200,000. They also have foreign cows and buffaloes such as the black and white ones from Australia, which are known for producing more milk than the local varieties, but these are very expensive and delicate so they require more care.",

A good piece of land with all the facilities can yield around 30,000 litres of milk,\u201d he says, adding that the average yield of the cattle on a good piece of land is 45,000 litres a year.\n\u201cSo, people from all over the country come here to buy it,\u201d he says, pointing at the people walking in and out of the area for buying the milk.\n\u201cThe milk from the first lot is sent to other cities, particularly Lahore, Faisalabad and Gujranwala, where there are a lot of dairy companies,\u201d he says. He adds that the quality is not compromised when it goes to Lahore. \u201cThe companies there ourselves do the work of quality checks. So, we don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d he says.\n\u201cVirtually all of the milk that we sell from here comes back here for another round of milking and the cycle continues. The milk the men produce here is sent back here to be used to make products that are sold in Karachi,\u201d adds Khan.\nAsked who, among the people from different areas of the country, are purchasing milk from Bhains Colony, Khan explains that the majority come from the south of the country including Hyderabad, Karachi, Quetta, etc. He says the region of Punjab produces good milk, which is the reason why the Punjab government has launched a project of supplying fresh milk there.\n\u201cBecause of the message given to the people by the Punjab government about consuming fresh milk they",

They are also hopeful that the government will help them increase the amount of land they have in the coming years as demand for milk keeps increasing.\n\u201cWhat we are producing is not just enough. We would need more land to grow the crops we need to feed the cattle they produce,\u201d says Malik.\nThe dairy farms are also working towards making the process of milking more humane for the animals. \u201cAlready, we have built shelters for the animals, made their kennels more spacious and felt chips into the floor so that the cows or buffaloes don\u2019t step on them,\u201d says Malik.\nAnd it isn\u2019t just them who are concerned about the animals\u2019 welfare.

    "text": "The Solar Decathlon is a wonderful idea, where teams from all over the world compete to design the most energy-efficient buildings which are, of course, solar powered. Most have tended to be the size of mobile homes, so that they can be built at the universities and shipped to the decathlon, and then shipped home. Most entries act like mobile homes, being detached buildings that will stand alone.\nThe DPD is a uniquely syncretic product of our study of two proven traditional housing typologies born of different cultures. The row house typology, typical of Montreal\u2019s urban fabric, accommodates single-family scenarios in a long and narrow low-rise form. The Siheyuan courtyard house demonstrates an environmentally and culturally specific approach to city dwelling of great historic, social, and functional value.\nThe DPD is also designed to the Passive House standard, which can be a challenge in a city like Montreal; there is a reason that an unofficial anthem for Quebec is Gilles Vigneault\u2019s \u201cMon pays, ce n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver\u201d (My country is not a country, it's winter). So it has a lot of insulation, an energy recovery ventilation system, and is designed for serious air-tightness. I looked in vain to see who the Passive House consultants were but see that they are \u201cusing passive design and construction principles\u201d to design \u201ca net-zero energy capable dwelling\u201d. A press release says that it is a \u201cPassive House-inspired design\u201d.\nAnother feature of the house is that it is prefabricated.\nA key innovation of the DPD is the utilization of off-site (factory) prefabrication methods of construction. It is designed for both modular & panelized options. Prefabrication addresses issues of affordability, reduction of waste, health and safety of workers, greater export capacity, and quality control to achieve high-performance building standards. Quebec\u2019s prefabrication industry is one of the most robust in North America and its expansion into the high-performance building industry is a key to its development.\nBut they are not doing Passive House quality prefabs in Quebec yet, so the team turned to Ecocor in Maine, which builds houses from Passive House quality panels. Chris Corson, founder and President of Ecocor tells TreeHugger that there was nobody in the Province who could deliver this and having seen Ecocor\u2019s work at the North American Passive House Network conference last year I can believe it, these are closer to cabinetry than wall panels. They had to be modified so that they could be easily taken apart in Montreal and reassembled in China, and the insulation was changed from Corson\u2019s preferred, cellulose, to what everyone in Canada loves (it\u2019s made there), Roxul rock wool.\nIt has all the smart home stuff, including \u201cSensor networks and Internet of Things technologies installed throughout the home for performance and durability monitoring, consumption, and automation.\u201d But with that much insulation, and being a townhouse with neighbours on either side, it is also what I like to call a dumb home- it is resilient in the face of power outages, and could keep people warm and safe for weeks.\nTeamMTL\u2019s goal is to employ socially, culturally and technologically advanced architecture that embodies energy efficiency, comfort, wellbeing, affordability, environmental sustainability and ecological awareness. Sustainable building starts with quality construction and design, and Ecocor\u2019s 21st Century, prefab approach to building the most energy efficient homes on the market today helped us reach our objectives.\nIt really does press all the buttons; small, urban design built with the most sophisticated prefab technologies to the highest standards of energy efficiency and comfort.

People think the Internet will supercede TV, but it\u2019s really been more additive than anything else, largely because it\u2019s so portable. It\u2019s not taking anything away from linear television; if anything, it\u2019s encouraged people to spend even more time watching video.\nAW: The fact that we can watch TV on a telephone: is this doing something insidious to the parts of our brain that process narrative?\nJL: Think about the very early days of TV\u2014the first shows were structured just like radio broadcasts or Broadway shows. You start with the familiar and you expand from there. Creative people haven\u2019t taken advantage of the new media platforms; we\u2019re still in this brackish time between two eras.\nAW: You still watch TV?\nJL: I\u2019m a binge watcher. I have DirecTV, so I have a ton of shows on the DVR: The Daily Show, [Real Time With] Bill Maher, SNL. I\u2019ve been watching How I Met Your Mother for six years. There are definitely more shows out there that I want to watch that I don\u2019t have time to watch, which I suppose is a great sign of where programming is headed.\nAW: Why did CBS issue a fatwa against Hulu?\nAW: Can you write code?\nJL: I never got into programming when I was a kid. I was too busy playing Pitfall and Kaboom! on Atari to write code. But then again, I don\u2019t think Les Moonves knows how to make a television set either.\nAW: So there\u2019s no disconnect between the old media centers\u2014New York, L.A.\u2014and Silicon Valley?\nJL: Well, you\u2019re looking at it from a geographic standpoint and that really isn\u2019t relevant any longer. I think Silicon Valley is the third leg of the media stool; I mean, there\u2019s a reason why all the animated features are made in Silicon Valley now.

That means I disbelieve in the whole ten thousand or so gods who have been held by some to be of utmost importance since hominids first stared at the stars and asked,\"Why?\"\nPeter Sellick only disbelieves in 9,999 or one less that I do.\nChristianity has only been around for 0.1% or less of the time which has elapsed since the first hominid started hunting for a living. We managed to survive without Christianity and domineering popes and other clerics for much of that time.\nIf they had their way we would go back to giving them the power over life and death as they had during the Inquisition and the Thirty Year War.\nAs Terry Lane said in a radio interview after writing \"God; The Interview\" all theologians make it up as they go along.\nPeter, I think you've explained the situation clearly. Unfortunately, apart from those who attack Christian faith from a scientistic (not merely scientific) viewpoint, there are also some within the church who don't understand that God is not supernatural.\nThe article is not about the institution but about some concepts central to Christian understanding. And I would suggest that the Christian path is about being fully human: far more than survival.\nI may be wrong, but you seem to be suggesting that God is simply constructed to explain the material world and the position of humans in it. I think that for many people the starting point of faith in God is not an intellectual effort to find a God to fill the gaps in knowledge. Rather it is an awareness, however faint, of the presence of God in their lives. The intellectual efforts to describe and understand this awareness become what we often call theology.\nSell, I think your whole argument falls down because the Christian church believes that God becaome flesh in the form of Jesus. This is an oxymoron if you wish to continue to believe in God as a spiritual being. He may be one or the other, but not both.\n\"there are also some within the church who don't understand that God is not supernatural.\"\nis an understatement. In a room of intellectually leaning church men and women I had the distinct feeling that I was the only one in the room that thought that God was not supernatural and who did not exist in the world as supernatural being. It seems that most of them wanted God to act somehow in the material world apart from the power of the Word in the Spirit. The providential God is alive and well!\nThank you Peter, for an interesting article. I have recently completed a course on the Trinity and would like to read your paper - would you be willing to post it on your website?\nYou may find it at: http://petersellick.nationalforum.com.au/admin/upload.php?\nIt is called \"At the origins of antitrinitarianism 2\"",

    "text": "It\u2019s amazing what a difference time can make in the way we perceive certain technologies. A few years ago, the idea of the cloud was terrifying to many people. What exactly did it mean to have something \u201cin the cloud\u201d? Was your personal information just floating around somewhere, ready for people to steal? Now, a lot of those hesitations have disappeared as people learned more about the cloud and its benefits. Businesses and individuals are more than willing to stick their information \u201cin the cloud,\u201d but it\u2019s really not that simple.\nSure, there are plenty of cloud providers in the market, but choosing the right one for your organization can be a tricky process. Brand name cloud providers are often seen as a reliable option for companies, but the truth is that they may not be the right option for your small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) needs.\nMigrating successfully to the cloud requires a SMB to have the right partner by its side, especially if it lacks cloud expertise or the time to develop an appropriate migration strategy. The right partner will be able to ensure that a SMB\u2019s cloud deployment meets regulatory requirements, offers future scalability and flexibility, and/or provides it with the most cost-effective option possible.\nAgain, finding a cloud provider that can do all of the above should be easy, but that\u2019s not always the case. A lot of cloud providers are focused on helping enterprises rather than SMBs. Luckily, there are some cloud providers that cater specifically to SMB customers.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about SMB cloud migrations and how to choose the right cloud provider to meet your company\u2019s needs, be sure to register for the upcoming webinar titled \u201cHow to Know if Your Cloud Decision is Right for Your SMB.\u201d The webinar, presented by Ed Dryer, senior technology strategist at Steadfast, will take place on Tuesday, August 22, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. EDT.\nAttendees will gain a better understanding of public, hybrid and private clouds for SMBs; learn the operational and cost benefits of virtualization; hear what is driving SMBs today to make cloud investments; and understand how cloud services complement business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) services, managed security, and on-demand infrastructure.

    "text": "President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s transition team held an hour and 15 minute meeting on Tuesday with just over a dozen social justice groups that presented what they see as the concerns of Catholics. In response, some Catholic bishops and commentators have told CNA that they don\u2019t believe these groups\u2019 concerns resonate with those of the Church.\nThe discussion between the Obama transition team and the different representatives touched on international development and trade, health care reform, reducing abortions, immigration, domestic policy and poverty reduction, and the environment.\nThe meeting of the 14 different organizations was organized by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good and the lobbying group \u201cNetwork,\u201d which describes itself as \"a progressive voice within the Catholic community\" that lobbies Congress on justice and peace issues.\nSr. Simone Campbell, director of Network, told the National Catholic Reporter that the meeting was called to \"acknowledge the work that some of the Catholic groups had done in the Catholic community during the election and to begin to develop relationships for \u2018post-Jan. 20,\u2019 when the new administration takes over after Obama\u2019s inauguration.\"\nJames Salt, Organizing Director of Catholics United, explained to CNA that Catholics United participated in the meeting by highlighting \"key policies that are important to Catholics.\n\"Specifically we want the new administration to take seriously its commitment to reduce abortions in America. People of goodwill from both sides of the conversation can agree that 1 million abortions a year are 1 million abortions too many. We wanted to make sure that the Obama administration knew this was one of our highest priorities.\"\nYet, when Salt was asked if Catholics United planned to hold Obama accountable for his pledge to work to reduce abortions, he was cautious. \"We're hopeful that the Obama administration is with us on abortion reduction. We were not there to make asks, but rather to build consensus around real solutions.\"\nSalt also added that no one raised the issue of Obama overturning the Mexico City Policy, which prevents American aid from going to those who counsel women on the availability of abortion.\nAlexia Kelley, Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, informed CNA that there are \"many efforts underway and planned\" to show support for the incoming administration as well as to challenge it to keep its abortion reducing commitment.\nAdditionally, Kelley mentioned that the topics of how to help the poor, homeless, children and the sick during these times of economic hardship were also raised.\nBoth Salt and Kelley confirmed to CNA that there was no one officially representing the Catholic Church present at the meeting, although they thought that an Obama team representative had met with key bishops at the USCCB.\nBishop Thomas Wenski, a member of the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on International Justice and Peace, reacted to the meeting by saying, \"while the Obama transition team is free to meet with anyone they wish\u2026the fact is that the only ones who speak for the Catholic Church are the bishops.\n\"If the transition team wished to telegraph a message that their intention is to marginalize the bishops then there is reason for some serious concern regarding the relationship between the future Obama administration and this nation's 60 million Catholics,\" Wenski said.\nCatholic scholar and author George Weigel expressed his doubts about the meeting\u2019s make up. \"If the Obama transition team thinks that meeting with the refugees from the Catholic revolution that never was is a way to open a dialogue with the Catholic Church in the United States, they're far less clever than I think they are. This strikes me as simply a pay-off to people who, from the Obama campaign's point of view, helped with the ground game in 2008.\"\nThe proof of the social justice groups\u2019 commitment to promoting Catholic concerns will be in \"how these \u2018Platform for the Common Good\u2019 folks help the rest of the Catholic Church defeat the Freedom of Choice Act and maintain the Bush administration's AIDS and malaria-reduction initiatives in Africa, which has helped millions more poor people than any of these groups has ever managed to do,\" Weigel explained to CNA.\nBishop of Madison Robert Morlino also added that the transition team must do more to dialogue with the Catholic Church. \"Recognizing the stark contrast between the positions on abortion of the President-elect and the teachings of the Catholic Church, it would be a mistake for the President-elect's transition team to pretend that this meeting satisfied his promise of dialoguing with the Catholic community,\" he said.\nThe bishop of Phoenix, Thomas Olmsted, also weighed-in on the meeting by addressing what a Catholic organization should be emphasizing. He told CNA that \u201cBeing 'right' on any number of other issues will never outweigh the taking of human life through abortion. It would be my hope that any group calling themselves 'Catholic' would make this message abundantly clear, and express grave concern over the possibilities that the new administration may increase funding for abortions with public money or even erode conscience protections for Catholic hospitals and healthcare workers.\"\nFinally, Brian Burch, who heads a group of four lay Catholic organizations in the political, legal, research and educational fields, also expressed misgivings about the ability of the social justice consortium to rein in Obama\u2019s policies.\n\"We are pleased to hear that the Obama transition team is interested in talking with Catholics, but caution that such conversations must be weighed against his reported plans on abortion policy, including his Cabinet selections thus far. Specifically, we remain concerned that the new Administration is composed of leading abortion advocates who are preparing to overturn a large number of existing pro-life laws, while proving hundreds of millions of new taxpayer dollars for abortion.\n\"The fact that transition officials are consulting a select group of Catholic organizations who supported Obama's candidacy is not surprising. Whether these groups, some of whom claim to adhere to Catholic teaching, are able to hold him accountable on the issue of life, remains doubtful.\"",

    "text": "Steven Spielberg has Ready Player One officially out in theaters today and Carl's Jr. tried to get in on the marketing fun by renaming their new charbroiled sliders to \"SpielBurgers.\" The legendary director caught wind of the fast food chain's publicity stunt and quickly shut it down after admitting that the sliders tasted \"pretty good.\" Though Carl's Jr. never officially renamed their product, they're pretty happy that they got some kind of reaction out of Steven Spielberg with a semi-endorsement.\nCarl's Jr. posted a bunch of spoof videos on Twitter advertising the name change of their sliders to the \"SpielBurgers\" to help promote Ready Player One and their new product. The videos each take on some of the director's most famous work, from E.T. to Jurassic Park. The fast food chain even decided to take their guerilla campaign to the next level when they had some of the \"SpielBurgers\" delivered to Amblin Entertainment yesterday, which prompted Steven Spielberg to record a response video and post it to Twitter.\nThe fast food chain tweeted over the weekend about the name change in honor of Ready Player One and noted that Steven Spielberg hadn't signed off, but that they \"assume that he's cool with it.\" In addition to the burgers, an employee even left a letter on an Amblin executive's car. After Carl's Jr. delivered the \"SpielBurgers\" to Amblin, the director announced a cease and desist to the fast food chain after sort of complimenting the taste of their creations. Spielberg had this to say.\n\"It has recently come to my attention that Carl's Jr. wants to rename their charbroiled sliders SpielBurgers and they're pretty good, but I'm passing. Cease and desist. You can't do it - sorry, guys.\"\nThe publicity stunt worked out perfectly for Carl's Jr. They knew that Steven Spielberg would never sign off on the deal, but if they got any response from him, it would be well worth it. Not only did Spielberg respond, he recorded a video that stated that \"SpielBurgers\" were pretty good, resulting in free promotion for the fast food chain and Ready Player One. Obviously, Carl's Jr. is pretty happy with the outcome that they orchestrated. Though the note on the executive's car was a tad bit creepy.\nAs for official partnerships, Ready Player One teamed up with the extremely popular HQ Trivia app for a record breaking prize of $250,000. The trivia game will take place tonight, March 28th at 6:30 PM Pacific and 9:30 PM Eastern, to celebrate the release of the movie. As for Steven Spielberg actually eating Carl's Jr., that has to be a bit of a white lie. One cannot imagine one of the most legendary directors of all time eating that type of fast food, even though our president mows down McDonald's more than once a week. You can check out the brilliant marketing plan to promote fast food and Ready Player One below, courtesy of the Carl's Jr. Twitter account.",

    "text": "The democratization of data is a real phenomenon, but building a sustainable data democracy means truly giving power to the people. The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. And this seems a lot more like a dictatorship than a democracy \u2014 a benevolent dictatorship, but a dictatorship nonetheless.\nThese individuals and companies aren\u2019t entirely bad, of course, and they\u2019re actually necessary. Apps that help predict what we want to read, where we\u2019ll want to go next or what songs we\u2019ll like are certainly cool and even beneficial in their ability to automate and optimize certain aspects of our lives and jobs. In the corporate world, there will always be data experts who are smarter and trained in advanced techniques and who should be called upon to answer the toughest questions or tackle the thorniest problems.\nLast week, for example, Salesforce.com introduced a new feature of its Chatter intra-company social network that categorizes a variety of data sources so employees can easily find the people, documents and other information relevant to topics they\u2019re interested in. As with similarly devised services \u2014 LinkedIn\u2019s People You May Know, the gravitational search movement, or any type of service using an interest graph \u2014 the new feature\u2019s beauty and utility lie in its abstraction of the underlying semantic algorithms and data processing.\nThe problem, however, comes when we\u2019re forced to rely on these people, features and applications to decide how data can affect our lives or jobs, or what questions we can answer using the troves of data now available to us. In a true data democracy, citizens must be empowered to make use of their own data as they see fit and they must only have to rely apps and experts by choice or when the task really requires an expert hand. At any rate, citizens must be informed enough to have a meaningful voice in bigger decisions about data.\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a whole new breed of startups trying to empower the data citizenry, whatever their role. Companies such as 0xdata, Precog and BigML are trying to make data science more accessible to everyday business users. There are next-generation business intelligence startups such as SiSense, Platfora and ClearStory rethinking how business analytics are done in an area of HTML5 and big data. And then there are companies such as Statwing, Infogram and Datahero (which will be in beta mode soon, by the way) trying to bring data analysis to the unwashed non-data-savvy masses.\nCombined with a growing number of publicly available data sets and data marketplaces, and more ways of collecting every possible kind of data \u2014 personal fitness, web analytics, energy consumption, you name it \u2014 these self-service tools can provide an invaluable service. In January, I highlighted how a number of them can work by using my own dietary and activity data, as well as publicly available gun-ownership data and even web-page text. But as I explained then, they\u2019re still not always easy for laypeople to use, much less perfect.\nStatwing spells out statistics for laypeople.\nCan Tableau be data\u2019s George Washington?\nThis is why I\u2019m so excited about Tableau\u2019s forthcoming IPO. There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau. It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself. Tableau\u2019s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I\u2019ve already referenced.\nAssuming it begins its publicly traded life flush with capital, Tableau will not just be financially sound \u2014 it will also be in a position to help the burgeoning data democracy evolve into something that can last. More money means being able to develop more features that Tableau can use to bolster sales (and further empower business users with data analysis), which should mean the company can afford to also continually improve its free service and perhaps put premium versions in the hands of more types of more non-corporate professionals for free.\nTableau is already easy (I made this) \u2014 but not easy enough.\nThe bottom-up approach has already proven very effective in the worlds of cloud computing, software as a service and open-source software, and I have to assume it\u2019s a win-win situation in analytics, too. Today\u2019s free users will be tomorrow\u2019s paying users once they get skilled enough to want to move onto bigger data sets and better features. But the base products have to be easy enough and useful enough to get started with, or companies will only have a lot of registrations and downloads but very few avid users.\nAnd if Tableau steps ups its game around data democratization, I have to assume it will up the ante for the company\u2019s fellow large analytics vendors and even startups. A race to empower the lower classes on the data ladder would certainly be in stark contrast to the historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite. That\u2019s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind.\nFeature image courtesy of Shutterstock user Tiago Jorge da Silva Estima.\nGreat article Derrick \u2013 appreciating your work on the topic here on GigaOm.\nWe\u2019re seeing wider availability of reasonably priced BI and visualization software tools to help us understand that harnessing all this data is possible \u2013 and I think even consumers are beginning to understand the value of all the data, and the ability to make meaning from it. One part of the puzzle that\u2019s missing from what I can see is the education \u2013 knowledge transfer of how individuals can use the tools, what good data science methods are, and how data citizens can actively contribute to the larger data analysis community. I see movements like the Open Data/Open Gov folks, and events like the NYC Big Apps hackathon as part of the solution \u2013 but as individuals, where do we go to take part? What is the role of an informed, curious citizen in this? More venues exist for learning some of the \u2018how\u2019 to make sense of big data as an individual taking a course online, but I\u2019m not seeing a vision from anyone talking about how to connect all of the dots. To make sense of data, we need the tools, the practitioners, the analysis of the problems, but we also need a vision of how all of these will work. If anyone has ideas of who\u2019s got that vision, I\u2019d love to hear it.\nI feel one of the biggest impediments to the democratization of data is access. Most people know what they would like to answer, and how the data needs to be shaped to achieve that, but getting the data to do the actual analysis with can be one of the most difficult aspects.\nThis is a bit of a plug, but we\u2019re working on enabling data access that is easily attainable by everyone. Our platform http://www.quandl.com is a \u201csearch engine for data\u201d that is able to fetch time series data from a disparate sets of sources, and provide it in a simple searchable form that allows users to extract, validate, format, merge, graph, and share it however they want.\nBy providing the underlying data for analysis tools like Tableau, Statwing, and many others, we feel we can help to create the tool stack that empowers people to create a sustainable DIY data culture.\nIn every company I\u2019ve worked at, I\u2019ve seen this major divide between IT analysts and Business users. Part of it was cultural, but a major reason was as you point out: \u201ca historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite\u201d. The business user typically was left to use Excel to prepare and analyze data.\nIt took 15+ years, but thanks to new players like Tableau, Spotfire and Qlikview which were sold primarily to the business user and focused on ease of use, the data democratization process has resulted in a power shift to the business user. Some IT departments have now come around and are trying to accommodate these \u201cshadow IT\u201d projects by providing IT support and giving Tableau users limited access to enterprise data stores.\nAs for upping the ante for the traditional players, it has happened already. Over the last two years, the larger vendors have responded with products like Visual Insight (MicroStrategy), Visual Intelligence (SAP), PowerPivot (MicroSoft), JMP (SAS) etc. taking aim at this segment of the market. The Big Data market is still new, but the trend to build user-friendly (or at the very least, SQL-aware) tools on top of Hadoop is also hitting its stride.\nOne good thing coming out of this data democratization is the realization that it has to be supported by a Data Governance effort. Otherwise we\u2019ll see the unfortunate return of a major problem with data democracy: data chaos. Previously it would have meant comparing and reconciling two Excel spreadsheets, now we may end up reconciling the findings from two Tableau workbooks.\nThanks for the comment, and for making a really good point about data governance. Obviously, that\u2019s not too big a concern for personal data use, but competing findings from lots of disparate data sets would be problematic.",

That\u2019s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind.\u201d These IT analysts maybe still need to help fulfil their role, but it\u2019s now simply not sustainable to keep building technology around a small group of people. The democratization of data will bring data scientists out of the woodwork, but also the great business users who are now fluent with technology and aren\u2019t afraid to make decisions with data.\nOnly then can this divide be bridged and the democratization of data will happen.\nCheers, Matt\n\nYou raise some good points about Tableau and the democratization of data. I definitely hope you are right that those involved in the IPO for Tableau are taking into account how they can help democratize data analytics. Right now there are a lot of good data democratization apps and tools, but Tableau has the potential to provide a lot more via its IPO. If I could make a small suggestion for Tableau (only if you think it\u2019s okay of course) \u2014 an idea for an app that could help democratize data analytics that could help you would be to let people create data maps from Excel spreadsheets. I know you talked about this in the post, but it\u2019s really a great way to help people understand how they can use the tools they already have to help them with data democratization.\nCheers, Matt\n\nI agree that the democratization of data will come from regular users being empowered to do the analysis they need/want. However, I don\u2019t think that these people are necessarily going to be business users but rather developers or analysts that have been empowered to make decisions with data. I think that the democratization of data will come from these people because these people are already tech savvy and already have the analytical skills.

    "text": "\"Whoever gets him, they'll be getting a good one,\" David Montgomery said.\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Hakeem Butler has been surrounded by some of the best wide receivers on the planet this week at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nIt\u2019s an experience that might humble some. But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.",

If violent crime increases across the Pond likewise in the UK. Then there is shopping madness.\nThe UK is taking up traditional US activities such as Christmas shopping bargain days that leave customers with empty wallets and a range of unwanted goods.\nBlack Friday has just passed and today is Cyber Monday. Each have become big shopping days on both sides of the Pond. Last Friday many people hit the shops attracted by huge price cuts and today the same is happening online. Is all as it seems though?\nAs usual the answer is probably not.\nIt is so easy to get sucked into spending unnecessarily. You buy in haste and repent at leisure. This year remember it is still in reality a consumer market. Businesses want your trade. That does not stop some of them throwing the odd rogue item into the pot.\nThis year more than ever retailers will be trying hard to get you to part with your hard-earned money. There will be pre-Christmas sales and bargains long after today. With Christmas a few weeks away perhaps it would be wiser to hang fire. Shop around, be it online or on the High Street, take your time and purchase well.\nBargains are sometimes far from that. They could be second-rate, last year's model or simply stock that is hard to shift. Once it is dressed up with a fancy cut-price sign you may find it hard to resist.\nConsider all the implications of your purchase before you buy.\n1- If you buy online there may be delivery charges but you will be saving a potentially expensive trip to town which could be full of hassle.\n2 - Emails dropping into your inbox, that offer great bargains, can be tempting. However, if you purchase an item you had no intention of buying is it really a bargain? Probably not, especially if money is tight.\nHaving some idea of what you want to buy helps. If you shop \"blind\" you will be more likely to spend more than you should. Online retail oulets, just like the shops, are full of goods you never knew you wanted or needed and in many cases cannot afford.\nCyber Monday also increases the temptation to buy now and pay later. Not a good idea. Pay for purchases online with a switch or debit card so you are not paying for Christmas well into the New Year or even beyond.\nOne factor specific to the UK is that this week Chancellor George Osborne will announce to the country his Autumn statement, or Budget. It is doubtful that it will have a real positive effect on retail trade but it could. It could also cost you dearly in many ways. Brits take care and look after your money this cyber Monday.\nPerhaps the rest of you would be wise to follow suit too!",

Because of their height, the windmills reflect other radio and television signals towards the Lofar station.\nMinister for economic affairs Henk Kamp has a year to decide whether to continue with the project. The plan has already been criticized by local residents and municipalities.\nThe Dutch telecom agency is currently looking into whether windmills interfere with radio telescope operation in Drenthe.\nMinister Kamp gave the project the go-ahead based on a study by a British company, which found that the operation of the telescope would not suffer if windmills were placed nearby. However, Astron argues that the British researchers didn\u2019t have sufficient knowledge to make that claim.\nAstronomers at the Lofar site would prefer if the windmills were at least 15km away from the telescope. The current plan would see seven of the fifty turbines placed within a 15km radius of the Lofar site.\n\u2018It might not sound like too much of a difference, but going from a few kilometres to fifteen really makes a big difference when it comes to the strength of the reflected signals,\u2019 said Garrett.",

The letter from the minister said he would evaluate the recommendations of the telecom agency and make a decision by the end of the year.\nMinister Kamp\u2019s office is looking into the matter in light of the Court of Appeal\u2019s recent decision in the case of Schippers Groep. In that case the court said that, in addition to the impact on radio astronomy, there was also a very real risk that the project would have a negative effect on the environment and the local economy.",

    "text": "Tulsa race riot survivor: \"Learn how to forgive, but never forget\"\nSAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A 100-inch, high definition screen projects an intense college basketball game. Massage therapists rub the nervous tensions of men and women away. Scissors skillfully cut men's hair. Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter.\nSean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California.\nThis is not your typical barbershop.\nAnd that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood.\n\"We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,\" says Heywood.\nMR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops.\n\"We're trying to thrive, not just survive,\" Heywood said.\nMR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network.\nThe two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track.\nAmong other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly.\n\"We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,\" Walker says.\nGiving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago.\n\"All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,\" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago.\nImagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area.\nThat was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921.\nBut on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.\nSound off: What challenges do black entrepreneurs face?\niReport.com: How would you make black America better?\n\"People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' \" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. \"We evacuated. They were destroying everything.\"\nThe death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials.\nThe riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered.\n\"It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses. I think we'd be a lot further ahead had that area been able to continue to thrive,\" says Walker.\nWess Young and his family rebuilt their lives in Tulsa. When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, \"We would have had a black president before now. ... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box.\"\nHis advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it.\n\"Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,\" Young says.\nWalker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him.\n\"I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,\" he says. \"I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.\"",
    "wm_text": "\nSo far, their message seems to be getting through to others, like Dolores Dale, owner of the barbershop.\n\"It feels good to know that people are doing so many wonderful things,\" she said.\nWalker and Heywood want to expand MR. to other cities in the near future and ultimately even start their own chain.\n\"It's a small world and if people don't start embracing the idea of creating their own businesses, finding opportunities in business, things that they believe is going to make a really positive impact in other spaces, things that they believe is going to make a culture that they want to see, they're really missing the whole point of business,\" says Heywood.\n\"It's a great example of the business community actually pushing back and making the right change and acknowledging the fact that this is where our culture is at. This is where business is going,\" Walker adds.\niReporters have felt compelled to help create a better America, or make it better, or fix things in America. iReporters have become instant experts on all things American.\nSome people have driven hundreds of miles to volunteer at soup kitchens, or literally built things that have helped make this nation great. Others have chosen to focus on their careers. Others are simply trying to help improve the lives of people around them.\nTheir projects range from health to green technology, or the environment, or education, or animal rights, or children's health care, or women's health care, or wildlife conservation.\nSome people are doing these things in a way that they think will make a positive impact. Others are doing these things because they need to. And still others are doing them as a favor to someone who could use a hand.\nSome people are doing these things so they can move back to their hometown after they graduated or earned their degree or went back to school. Others are doing these things so they can move back to their hometown after they graduated or earned",

But Jacobsen, a consultant who advises businesses \u2013 primarily convenience stores \u2013 on where best to locate, said it will overall hurt the businesses in Washoe City. He said that applies especially to convenience stores, the gas station and businesses like the Chocolate Factory and Nevada Lynn Emporium which rely on impulse buyers seeing them and deciding to stop.\nHe said Paul Marazzo, owner of Washoe Flats restaurant \u2013 formerly the Cattleman\u2019s \u2013 may benefit because his is a destination rather than an impulse stop.\nMarazzo is counting on that. He said when the trucks and other through traffic move to the new freeway, it will also make it much easier and safer for drivers seeking a nice dinner at the restaurant he and his brother, Lynn, operate. And, as the valley develops, he said he\u2019ll get more and more local business.\nAt the same time, he said the freeway will make it easier for people to come to his restaurant because they\u2019ll be able to take the freeway to Parker Ranch Road just south of the restaurant.\nAnd in the meantime, he said the freeway construction crews are excellent customers.\nShe said traffic is the issue and she has been involved in efforts to get people to slow down through the valley.\nTyson Petty, manager of Old Washoe Station, the gas station and mini-mart to the north, made similar comments.\nCouch and Petty both said their businesses may be hurt somewhat but neither thought the loss of traffic would put them out of business.",

He said he sees customers from the highway more than he sees customers from the resort\u2019s parking lots and hotel guests.

That's why the Kinect-powered Hulk Hogan's Main Event focuses as much on winning the crowd as it does winning the match.\nTerry Gene Bollea didn't become one of the world's most iconic wrestlers by knowing how to do an Atomic Drop. He did it by becoming Hulk Hogan, a bombastic, charismatic, and generally larger-than-life personality capable of bending a crowd to his will whether a shining red and gold hero or a black-stubbled villain. The man knows how to put on a show. Hopefully he knows how to put on a game as well.\nIn Hulk Hogan's Main Event, developed by Panic Button for Majesco, the Impact Wrestling superstar takes players' custom characters under his meaty wing, guiding them on the path to stardom. He'll coach them on his signature poses as well as more than 30 wrestling combos using MIcrosoft's Kinect sensor to measure their movements. The more dynamic their motions, the more effective their performance. Once they feel the true power of Hulkamania coursing through their veins players are sure to dominate the game's nine increasingly lavish venues. It even supports two-player tag team matches, complete with virtual metal chairs and ladders, which certainly won't lead to anyone getting seriously hurt.\n\"Listen up, people! You will feel the power of Hulkamania when you step into this game,\" said Hulk Hogan. \"Whether you are taking the damage or selling the pain, this game will let you unleash your inner wrestler as you hype up the crowd while putting the hurt on anyone that stands in your way!\"\nHe's right! Too long have our inner wrestlers been leashed! Too long have our wrestling games delivered the sport without the spectacle! It's time to put on the hurt!\nSee? The guy is really good at that.\nHulk Hogan's Main Event is due out this fall from Majesco. Keep an eye out for more Hulkamania during E3 early next month.",

This summer all the narcoleptic gamblers, crocks, and 'ard workers seem to be tied down to lengthy contracts elsewhere.\nMuch to my son&apos;s continued disgust, Stoke City are the least interesting Premiership club to support during the transfer window.\nAlmost the entire school summer holidays can be wasted parked in front of Sky Sports News watching absolutely nothing happening.\nOr as Sir Anthony Pulis would put it, &apos;waiting for something to drop&apos;.\nFrankly it&apos;s enough to turn a 15 year old into a Sunderland fan, at least for the duration of the window.\nHow exciting that must be: watching players come, go, nearly come, nearly go, pass within 150 miles of the Stadium of Light on their way to visit the in-laws only to find themselves snapped up on double the salary just because they stopped off for a cup of tea somewhere outside Carlisle.\nContrast that with Stoke City; for a start you can discount any player we&apos;re linked with as they will also be linked to several other clubs all of whom will be prepared to pay them more money and probably not ask them to work quite so &apos;ard.\nWe know immediately whether they&apos;re a genuine possibility if the announcer on SSN prefaces the player&apos;s name with &apos;injury prone&apos;, &apos;addict&apos;, &apos;convicted murderer&apos;, &apos;cat-strangler&apos;, &apos;pensioner&apos;, &apos;free agent&apos;, &apos;recently retired&apos;, &apos;unknown&apos; and so on.\n3. &apos;ard working players from the championship who are not quite good enough but might be as long as \"they buy into this football club&apos;s &apos;ard work ethic of &apos;ard work and then more &apos;ard work followed by a day of really really &apos;ard work as a reward for all their &apos;ard work \"\nOur only signing to date, Jonathan Woodgate, is the living (or barely living) embodiment of Category 2, suffering, as he does, from every single complaint listed above.\nBut apart from him, we remain seated in front of SSN with no expectations other than to be informed of a whole host of players who&apos;ve turned us down for being unglamorous, not in the north and not in the south (that\u2019ll be the midlands then), not paying enough, not liking our style of football, not liking cold, wind or rain, having an allergy to the angle of the roof on the Family Stand, their agent not liking the M6, there being no Pizza Express in Stoke, and preferring Cliff Richard to Tom Jones thus only being prepared to sign if the fans dispense with Delilah and adopt Wired For Sound as their anthem.\nWe are the masters of the last minute deal, many of whom we get really, really excited about like Eidur Gudjohnnsen only to discover the reason they came to us was.... was..... well, actually none of us can work out why Eidur came to us except that we were pathetically grateful to sign a player of his stature and prepared to pay him a wad of cash without realising he&apos;d formally retired from the game but singularly failed to inform anyone of the fact.\nAnd then there are the last minute signings that barely warrant a raising of the head from the summer long transfer inactivity torpor, like Jon Walters & Dean Whitehead, who turn out to be worth a thousand Eidur Fatjohnnssens and exemplify further TP&apos;s mastery of the dark arts of footballing alchemy.\nWe sit, we wait, we arch an eyebrow, we groan, we nod off, and we repeatedly utter the mantra that has served us so well in the past: &apos;Trust in Tony&apos;.\nOr we pretend to support Sunderland for the close season.",

The time before, Gianluca Zambrotta was one of the most talked-about players in the land and Stoke City put up full billboards to advertise his arrival on the cheap from West Ham.\nBut neither Bent or Zambrotta made the grade. Neither scored regularly enough for us, and neither looked like doing so.\nTheir failures to make the grade are now forgotten. You&apos;d suggest, with some good reason, that the arrival of Jonathan Walters and Darren Fletcher does more than any pairing of wingers, center forwards, or full-backs to fill the gaping hole in the middle of the Stoke City attack. Walters adds goals. Fletcher adds something that nobody else in the Stoke City squad can: class.\nWalters is a good signing, in an obvious way, and is something of a step up from Bent and Zambrotta. Walters scores goals. Walters finds the net regularly.\nSo why aren&apos;t we more excited?\nPerhaps it&apos;s because it felt like an easy way out; the easy way to make up for losing Chris Sutton to Blackburn. Perhaps it felt like the right thing to do; the right thing for the club to do.\nPerhaps it was the right thing for us to do. But it certainly isn&apos;t the right thing for us to do. The easy way out is not always the right way. And even if it were, should it always be?\nPay the \u00a315 million, or whatever Brighton were prepared to pay for Sutton the season before, or made up from the \u00a310 million or so we&apos;d get for him.

The majority of Americans oppose taxpayer funding to this unethical organization.\n\nThe Left\u2019s incredible growth of pro-abortion legislation in recent years has brought a massive influx of abortion clinics into the U.S. \u2014 a number that has more than tripled since 2003, and has more than doubled since 2008. The Pro-Life Action League\u2019s annual Abortion Report tells the story of the more than 7,500 abortion facilities that now exist across the country.\n\nJust this past year, efforts to expand the abortion market scored some significant wins. Already, 70,000 abortions can be performed every year in New York, a number that will rise to 90,000 if the recently passed legislation becomes law. In an effort to expand the market, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the Reproductive Health Act, which mandates that insurance plans must cover abortions and abortion pills. This law is currently on appeal in the state\u2019s highest court.\n\nIn a separate effort, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a law that allows any New Jersey woman to have an abortion at any time during the pregnancy, regardless of the reason. This law is part of a broader effort in the state to expand the abortion market. This is especially disturbing considering that the number of abortions performed in the state has doubled since 1990.\n\nIn other states, lawmakers have worked to expand the supply",

    "text": "Gaza is an open air prison where one and a half million people are deprived of adequate water, electricity, opportunities to farm, and the right to move about their own land or the world freely. Palestinian children are detained without charge for months and when charged, they are tried in military courts. Gazan schools are insufficient and the funds often cut. An Israeli museum is built over a centuries old Muslim graveyard. Ancient olive trees, the livelihood of Palestinian farmers are burned. Homes are bulldozed. A blockade prevents goods from coming into and out of Palestine, inhibiting commerce and the means for a livelihood. Water is diverted from its source directly to Israel where it is abundantly available, including for swimming pools, while Palestinians have to buy water from tanker trucks. (A Durham Presbyterian church funded water purifiers for Gaza schools after the bombing of U.N. schools.) The wall closing off Israel from Palestinians makes everyday life difficult. Israeli settlements take more land from Palestinians every year. Drones fly 24 hours a day spying on and frightening the residents of Gaza.\nThe asymmetry of the two sides is extreme. A few rockets a week fall into north Israel and if they hit an Israeli citizen, Israel attacks with an over-the-top force, killing hundreds of Palestinians. Palestinians have only stones, and now knives, to express their frustration and anger.\nThose who support Israel based on religious beliefs do not realize that Palestine Christians also suffer under the burden of the Israeli occupation. The Presbyterian Church of America, and The Episcopal Peace Fellowship have spoken out about the repression in their book and DVD called, \u201cSteadfast Hope\u201d for their parishioners. It is painful to watch and read.\nPalestinian student campus organizations face bureaucratic harassment, severe restrictions on and censorship of their columns, even cancellations of their speakers. If they do win the battle to publish their viewpoint, Jewish organizations immediately spring into action to overwhelmingly deny and refute their message.\nMovies, media and games perpetuate stereotypes with Palestinians depicted as terrorists and villains, vicious gunmen, wide-eyed maniacs killing anyone, anywhere, any time for any reason. Movies and television programs such as \u201cTyrant,\u201d \u201cDig\u201d and \u201cHomeland\u201d depict Arabs as the lowest of human beings.\nThis in contrast to positive portrayals of Israelis, such as Ziva David as a Mossad agent in \u201cNCIS.\u201d Europeans are speaking out about the Gaza tragedy, but American voices are silenced out of fear of being accused as anti-Semitic. A major conference, \u201cThe Israel Lobby: Is It Good for the US, Is It Good for Israel?\u201d received no main stream media coverage.\nHow to get the message out? Jewish organizations inside Israel and the U.S. are working for peace and to let the world know of the suffering of the Palestinians. That is the message the protesters want to bring to the council and the public.\nEleanor Kinnaird is a former state senator and mayor of Carrboro.",

    "text": "James finished the preseason ranked tied for 14th in scoring (13.7 points per game) among league forwards.\nExhibition numbers mean little, or perhaps nothing, in the grand scheme of a season, but Bosh\u2019s statistical effort during the preseason is anything but irrelevant \u2014 or random \u2014 when taken in the correct context. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra spent the entire training camp drilling his players on the idea of a free-flowing, equal-opportunity offense. That Bosh, Mr. Random Guy, emerged from training camp as the team\u2019s leading scorer means the Heat\u2019s offense is healthy heading into the season opener against the Celtics on Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.\nMore often than not, Bosh is open on the offensive end. The ball found him during the preseason, and Bosh\u2019s skills did the rest. He led the Heat in field-goal percentage (.551) while also leading the team in rebounds (43).\nJames is the driving force behind Spoelstra\u2019s idea of \u201cpositionless basketball,\u201d but Bosh might be the second-most important cog in the wheel. On most nights, Bosh is the quickest big man on the floor, and his consistent jump shot allows him to stretch defenses.\nConventional defensive strategy against the Heat calls for packing the paint to account for Wade and James. Entering his third season with the Heat, Bosh knows where to find the open spots on the periphery. He likes to call those opportunities random, but, when paired with James, the results are more like basketball jazz.\n\u201cHe\u2019s open,\u201d said James, who led the Heat with 41 assists in the preseason. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with a lot more pace and a lot more space for him, and giving him a lot more opportunities to go at his matchup.\nWade credits Bosh\u2019s big preseason to his work before training camp. Bosh skipped the Olympics to fully heal from the abdominal injury he sustained in the playoffs. Upon his return, he met with Wade and James and vowed to carry more of the load early in the season.\nWhen Bosh first arrived in Miami, the Heat wanted him to pack on muscle mass and bulk up for a life in the paint. Spoelstra scrapped that plan after the playoffs when the Heat used an unconventional lineup to win its second NBA championship. The Heat\u2019s coach instructed Bosh to focus on his natural skill set: speed, quickness and shooting.\nBosh averaged 18.0 points per game last season, but Wade says Bosh is capable of \u201cgoing for 20-plus a game and probably more effortlessly than\u201d himself and James.\nWhile Bosh has accepted the label of center, offensively he\u2019s more of a hybrid power forward than anything. The position of a traditional center is a dying art in the NBA, so much so that the league has removed the designation from All-Star ballots this season.\nFans will now vote for three \u201cfrontcourt players\u201d and two guards rather than two guards, two forwards and a center. Despite the change, Bosh still doesn\u2019t expect to garner any more votes for a starting spot.\n\u2022 The Heat finalized its 15-man roster on Saturday, cutting point guard Garrett Temple. Miami begins the season with 12 players from its championship team. Forward Rashard Lewis, forward Josh Harrellson and guard Ray Allen are the new additions.",

The full court press is still a work in progress, but I like what I am seeing.\n\nBosh is playing too much and he really looks really tired at times.\n\nI dont think Bosh is the same player he was pre-injury. Bosh is a really good player but I think he needs to be more of an enforcer in the post. He just needs to pick his spots more wisely.\n\nHe is a limited player right now. I agree he should be more of an enforcer in the post. But part of his limited play is simply because the Heat are trying to get the ball more through the posts. By playing more through the posts, the Heat have been spreading the floor and spreading the defense out. It's an experiment that the Heat are trying, and it's working.\n\nAlso, Bosh is in his prime and I don't see him losing it anytime soon.\n\nBosh will always be a solid player, especially when playing with the right talents.\n\nI think the Heat will be fine this season. However, they do need to work on their defense. Even though Wade is the best one-on-one defender in the league, I think the Heat should have been better in the pick and roll. In the last two seasons, I think the Heat should have prevented teams from getting easy layups and dunks.\n\nI think the Heat will be the same team this season, but they will have a higher ceiling.

Millennials received this info gratefully; finally, a thing we were not responsible for, an errand we did not actually have to do. Unfortunately, this is wrong; in fact, everyone should get the flu shot.\nLast year\u2019s flu season was the worst in a decade, worse than the year of swine flu. Over 80,000 people died. There are many factors at work, but a big one that medical professionals attributed to the unusually high rate of deaths and infections was a drop in the rate of adults who bothered to get their shot \u2014 yes, those same people between the ages of 18 and 65 who \u201cdon\u2019t need\u201d it.\nTo think about vaccines as they affect each person individually is blinkered; sure, you don\u2019t want to get sick, but more than vaccines prevent individual illness, they prevent illnesses from spreading. We see this already with children in locations where it\u2019s trendy among parents to simply not get their kids vaccinated from preventable diseases like measles out of irrational fears; because of those parents, those diseases spread faster and people die more frequently. Epidemics happen because of new, wild, aggressive disease strains, but they also happen for lack of prevention. More to the point, just because you can afford to miss work or buy medication when you get sick doesn\u2019t mean others can.\nIn the same way you don\u2019t not vote because nothing is bothering you specifically, you don\u2019t not get the flu shot because you are very likely to survive it yourself. This is how social contracts work: How a collective action impacts you personally is maybe the least important thing, especially if you are in the most privileged group. Please get your flu shot.",

AI671 was taking off from Mumbai and reaching Chennai at 10.45 am every day from 1976.\nThe flight would leave for Madurai at 11.30 am. It was taking off from Madurai to reach Chennai at 2.15 pm.

He was batting .299 this year with 7 homers and 43 RBI.\nThroughout the last couple of seasons, Jesse Winker dealt with pain his right shoulder.\nAfter he felt more pain Monday, it was determined that Winker would need surgery to repair his shoulder. He will miss the remainder of the season.\nThe Reds placed Winker on the 10-day disabled list Thursday with a right shoulder subluxation.\n\"Man, I have no idea it is,\" said Winker. \"I know my shoulder hurts. That\u2019s all I know.\"\nWinker said the pain was \"off and on\" all season but Monday was essentially the final straw.\nOn first base during a comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals, Winker ducked under a line-drive single from Tucker Barnhart in the ninth inning and fell to the ground on the base paths. Winker later scored the game-winning run.\nA potential Rookie of the Year candidate, Winker was batting .299 this season with seven homers and 43 RBI. The outfielder ranked fourth in the Majors with a .405 on-base percentage. He had more walks (49) than strikeouts (46).\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Winker was emotional about the end of his season.\n\"Obviously, I was hoping that surgery wasn\u2019t the end result but I\u2019ve been dealing with this for 2-3 years,\" Winker said. \"Just got to the point now where it\u2019s time to go fix it.\"\nIt's a tough loss for the Reds' lineup, which was already without outfielder Scott Schebler. On the DL, Schebler began a rehab assignment Wednesday, going 1-for-3 with a walk as a designated hitter at Triple-A Louisville.\nWinker, based on what he's been told from doctors, said his goal is to return by Feb. 1, 2019. He said he felt the pain when he completed \"any baseball move.\"\n\"There were times where it affected his swing,\" Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman said. \"He altered his swing path because of the pain. That\u2019s a tough way to play at the Major League level. He did a heck of a job. I don\u2019t think anybody realized that he was going through it as much as he was.\"\nMason Williams, an outfielder at Louisville, was called up to fill Winker\u2019s roster spot. Williams played in 25 games with the New York Yankees over the past three seasons.\nA left-handed hitter, Williams signed with the Reds as a minor league free agent last offseason.\nWilliams was batting .280 with six homers and 30 RBI in 87 games at Louisville. He recorded a hit in 13 of his last 14 games.\n\"It\u2019s been a matter of me being healthy and staying on the field and playing my game and just having confidence in myself,\" Williams said.\nWilliams, once considered the Yankees' top prospect, learned of his promotion to the big leagues Thursday morning.\nHe played on the same high school team in Florida as Cardinals pitcher Austin Gomber, who had a no-hitter against the Reds for six innings Tuesday. The two players will sometimes train together in the offseason.\nTo make room on the 40-man roster for Williams, the Reds moved injured infielder Alex Blandino (torn ACL in his right knee) to the 60-day DL.\n\"He\u2019s had productive at-bats, competitive at-bats, against both left-and-right-handed pitching,\" Riggleman said of Williams. \"He\u2019s a good athlete. We\u2019re confident he will come up here and do a good job.\"\nSCHEBLER STILL PROGRESSING: Schebler was in Louisville's lineup as a designated hitter for his second rehab game Thursday.\nBut the key to his return will be when he's comfortable making throws.",

    "text": "Question: What's one company culture characteristic that you have found makes your startup employees the happiest? How do you make sure you're implementing it?\n\"Every six weeks, we have scheduled, highly structured bi-directional reviews with every employee. The predictability and structure of these meetings make it extremely easy for employees to deliver feedback, both good and bad. This level of transparency and communication keeps employees happy and motivated.\"\n\"At RTC, we have a motto as a publisher: \"Don't expect your reader to change through reading your book if you haven't changed through writing it.\" That motto defines our core belief that continual growth is necessary for the human spirit to regularly experience joy in the workplace. As a result, our executive team strives to help our staff remove aspects of their work that do not bring them joy so that they can focus on what they love doing. By intentionally making room for them to focus on what they enjoy, they are able to grow out aspects of the business that bring them deep personal satisfaction while also serving our clients. We've developed entire new lines of business this way, as well as new positions within the company. Support their dreams, and they will grow your business.\"\nFollow Rule #2: Have Fun!\n\"When my co-founder and I started 'ZinePak, our business plan read simply, \"Make money. Have fun.\" As the company has grown, we've made sure not to lose sight of this mission. At the end of each day, we ask our employees if they had fun that day. Almost without fail, the answer is always \"yes.\" We try to always remember that we're an entertainment company. We aren't changing the world. We aren't curing cancer. No one's life is at risk, so there is no need for the doom-and-gloom culture that seems so prevalent in Corporate America. From half-day Fridays to candy jars to days off for charitable activities of the employee's choice, we try to mix \"fun\" into everything possible to ensure that work feels as much like play as possible.\"\n\"We always take time to celebrate our wins. Whether it's a new project, new teammate or new launch, we take time to recognize team and individual successes. Taking small breaks to socialize and catch up at team happy hours reenergizes the team and ultimately leads to awesome workflow and collaboration. Our internal party planning committee makes consistent plans to pull us away from our desks and into fun environments where we can take our minds off work for a bit.\"\n\"I think that people are generally happiest at work when they are engaged by the work that they do. Doing the same jobs, having the same responsibilities and facing the same tasks day in and day out can get tiresome. In my company, there is a variety of work to be done, and employees are encouraged to embrace the variety. This keeps work fresh. We also support telecommuting (to the degree that we don't even have a \"home\" office -- all work is done \"off-site\") and flexible schedules. We trust our team to do their work when they can and where they can. Work variety and flexible work results in employees who are happy and productive. \"\n\"When we started, we had been told to be careful of what we share with our employees and other stakeholders. We, however, are very open and transparent communicators and did not keep anything confidential and didn't hold back any information. This allowed our early employees to not only feel like they were playing an important trusted role in making an impact on growing the company, but also allowed them to dissent and suggest better ways of accomplishing objectives. They respected the founders because they saw not just what decisions we made, but how we made them, right or wrong. And for failed experiments, we had their support and morale to pivot quickly. Each and everyone felt individual ownership for each decision and worked that much harder to succeed, because they never felt separate.\"\n\"Every other Friday, someone different leads our team workout. We've played tennis and basketball, done yoga and CrossFit and even learned (barely) various martial arts. Unintentionally, we've taken risks doing new things, discussed how we're improving our lives (not just our work) and laughed a lot. The benefits of exercise combined with the additional vulnerability, camaraderie and fun has increased the happiness quotient of Team Fig. \"\n\"When people hear the words \"company culture,\" they often think about ping pong tables or beer taps. While those sorts of perks are cool, they really don't matter unless you've created the right work environment to embrace them. You create that environment by giving people a voice. When we built our new corporate office space, it was very important to solicit opinions and ideas from our employees. Before moving into our new facility in 2011, we hosted an internal version of Pinterest where employees could put ideas and pictures that they felt should be considered for the new space and workstation setups. In the end, when you're making a decision based on democratic feedback, you need transparency. People will be invested in the outcome as long as they feel like the process is fair. \"\n\"The characteristic that I swear by is living the mission every day. Oftentimes, people join your team/company as a startup because you are doing something different or you're doing something the way no one has done it before. You cannot afford to lose that, and you have to live that everyday. For us, that is our mission. Everyone who has joined our team is in it for the mission, and we push it and live it every day, which makes our team members happy. \"",
    "wm_text": "\nFollow Rule #3: Start With Family\n\"Prior to launching our company, we had been in business for several years. When my wife was pregnant with our first child, we had to make a decision to keep going as we had been for the first couple years, or to pull out before the baby came and start over. We decided to pull out before the baby came full time to focus more on our family.\"\n\"In our previous business we didn't do a great job with family. My wife and I felt really guilty about leaving our son with family and going on business trips, and even more guilty about bringing our son on business trips. When we decided to make our first company official, we made sure it was something we could do without putting our family in an unsafe situation, which meant quitting our old jobs and starting from scratch. Once we had made that decision, we worked hard to make sure our son could be surrounded by a stable family life before making the switch.\"\nFollow Rule #4: Take Responsibility\n\"When we say we are living the mission, it involves more than just our company. It means we are not looking for excuses, but rather looking for solutions that will help us accomplish the mission in a better way.

We loved the city, but more importantly we loved our time with our families. When we moved back to the South, we worked our schedules around our kids. We would make sure they went to school with us, we would put them on the bus, and we would send them off to school. For us, finding a balance between work and life was our priority, and that balance really made a difference in our family life. We made it a point to make sure our priorities were in line. We wanted to raise our children with good values and morals and show them that money can't buy you happiness. \"\n\"When we started, we had very few employees. We are a small company with a small workforce, so we wanted to make sure our employee development was a priority and that we placed a strong emphasis on loyalty. We want to create a culture where we pay our employees well, treat them with respect, and when they leave, we want them to miss them. We want to make sure the quality of our employees is equal to the quality of our product. We wanted to create a workplace where people could grow and thrive, and that's what we've done. \"\nFollow Rule #4: Lead By Example\n\"When we felt that the company was ready to take the next step, we went to the board meeting and asked for the authority to hire a VP of Operations. We hired my husband. From that point, I have made sure that I am the one who goes out of my way to train our new hires and show them around the office. We have an open door policy where people are able to call me personally to ask questions, the same way I would call HR. It's important to show that I'm not just the president of the company.

And it doesn't have to be created with paint on canvas, sculpted from clay, or chiseled in stone.\nSometimes all it takes is a simple piece of chalk and a public sidewalk. That's the theory behind the annual Chalk Art Festival, which is June 13 at the Uptown Shopping Center in Richland. Registration starts at 8 a.m. Chalkers will begin their work at 9 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m.\n\"Chalk art is a wonderful and unique form of creativity,\" said Gus Sako, the event's organizer and owner of the Octopus' Garden novelty store in the Uptown.\n\"Give the smallest toddler a piece of chalk and sidewalk and they will be happy for hours,\" he said.\n\"I get off work and usually just head to the sidewalk,\" she said with a chuckle. \"It's just too irresistible not to take part.\"\nBoth women also say creating chalk art can wreak havoc on the body, especially the knees, the back and shoulders.\n\"It's pretty hard for anyone to whip out a drawing in the hot sun on a dirty sidewalk. And, at almost 66, my knees are pretty creaky,\" Loomis said. \"On the other hand, my kids just gave me a gardening stool with rails that might be just the thing!\"\nCalicoat says creating chalk art is like doing one-arm push ups for hours.\n\"I've been trying to train myself to use my left hand to paint so I'll probably do the same thing with chalk,\" Calicoat said.\nThe Chalk Art Festival was started by the now defunct Corporate Council for the Arts as a regional arts activity, Sako said. The festival moved to several locations until it finally settled at the Uptown a few years ago.\nCategories and registration fees are: Up to age 5 $5; Ages 6-9 $5; Ages 10-12 $7; Ages 13-17 $7; Ages 18 and older $12. Sidewalks to be used for the chalk artistry will be on George Washington Way, Jadwin Avenue, Symons Streets and Williams Boulevard.\nFor more information, call 946-0077 or 943-6542.",

Sickinger had a strap he planned to use to bridle the horse, but he said better judgment took over and he decided the horse was too wild to control even if he could wrangle it.\nSickinger told a St. Clair County sheriff\u2019s deputy the horse might belong to a neighbor. There are several horse farms in the area, but none came forward as the owner, Sickinger said.\nMoments after Sickinger started petting the horse, a truck drove by and the horse followed after it. No one would see the horse until more than a week later.\nOn Wednesday, area resident Aranza Lee spotted the horse in a soybean field near Imbs Station and Wagner roads, less than a mile from Sickinger\u2019s home. She captured a video of the horse running freely through the field and shared it to the Millstadt News Facebook page. By Thursday afternoon, the post had more than 400 shares, but no one had come forward as the owner.\n\u201cI mean, how weird is that?\u201d said Sara Yoch of Smithton, a self-described horse-lover.\nLt. Alan Haake of the St. Clair County Sheriff\u2019s Department said the department has received several reports over the past three weeks about the missing horse, but he said no one has come forward as the owner, nor has anyone been able to catch it.\nYoch was out at the intersection of Otten and Wagner roads Thursday afternoon with a bucket of feed and a lead, looking for the horse. She said she was out in the same area Wednesday for about four hours, but didn\u2019t have any luck.\nShe warned area residents to avoid approaching the horse if they aren\u2019t familiar with how horses behave, and to slow down when driving through the area. Yoch said a horse standing in a road on a dark night can cause serious damage to a vehicle and hurt the driver, as well as the horse, of course.\nIt\u2019s possible the horse was dumped, according to Stephanie Goepfert, a member of the Lincoln Trail Riders in O\u2019Fallon. It can easily cost more than $500 a month to care for a horse, Goepfert said, and it\u2019s possible the owner could not afford to keep it.\nOn its own, the horse could get sick or injured, Goepfert added.\n\u201cThey can survive for a period of time in the wilderness, but if they\u2019re a domesticated animal, they\u2019re relying on a certain diet. It can be bad for them,\u201d Goepfert said.\nThey can survive for a period of time in the wilderness, but if they\u2019re a domesticated animal, they\u2019re relying on a certain diet.

He said the US also supported Afghan President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s offer for comprehensive negotiations with the Taliban on a mutually agreed agenda. \u201cWe remain ready to support, facilitate, and participate in direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban,\u201d said the US diplomat.\nEarlier this week, Mr Pompeo telephoned the Saudi crown prince and also asked him to help arrange a ceasefire during Eidul Azha. The United States hopes that the ceasefire will enable the Taliban to experience the blessings of peace while celebrating the festival with their families.\nMr Pompeo, who will be arriving in Islamabad after the ceasefire, is expected to urge the new Pakistani government to back its efforts for bringing a durable peace in Afgha\u00adnistan. In return for Pakistan\u2019s support in Afghanistan, Washington may drop its opposition to a $12 billion aid package with the IMF and consider restoring its security assistance to Pakistan.\nAfghanistan was on Monday awaiting the Taliban\u2019s response to President Ghani\u2019s proposal for a three-month ceasefire, an offer welcomed by the US and Nato after nearly 17 years of war, according to AFP.\nThe president said his office had cleared \u201call obstacles\u201d to peace with the announcement following consultations with religious scholars, political parties and civil society groups.\nThe Taliban did not immediately respond to President Ghani\u2019s truce offer, but vowed to release \u201chundreds\u201d of \u201cenemy prisoners\u201d to mark the Eidul Azha holiday. A Taliban member told AFP that the leadership had yet to issue a formal response to the ceasefire, but suggested fighting might be restrained during Eid even if no announcement was made.",

    "text": "The bullpen collapsed again as the Diamondbacks lost for the 13th time in the past 19 games.\nDENVER \u2013 The cast has changed for the Diamondbacks, only they keep playing out the same tired script, one brutal night after another. In a deathly quiet visitors\u2019 clubhouse, players sat motionless in front of their lockers late Wednesday night, seemingly stunned by the realization that their misery could reach new depths.\nYoshihisa Hirano, only recently given the reins in the closer\u2019s role, became the latest Diamondbacks reliever to get beat in excruciating fashion, serving up D.J. LeMahieu\u2019s opposite-field, walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth of a 5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night.\nThe Diamondbacks were two outs away from shaving their deficit in the National League West to just 1 1/2 games. Instead, it could grow to 4 1/2 games by the time they leave town on Thursday evening.\nHanded a 4-3 lead in the ninth, Hirano allowed a leadoff single to Gerardo Parra, a hard-hit ball that first baseman Paul Goldschmidt could not handle, and, two batters later, Hirano left a fastball over the plate that LeMahieu smacked into the right-field seats.\nThey did get a lead. They did get a solid outing from lefty Patrick Corbin. And they did get good relief work through the eighth inning. But while the ninth was a disaster, the Diamondbacks\u2019 offense once again gave the pitching staff little breathing room.\nWith one out in the fourth, Alex Avila launched a solo home run to center field to extend the Diamondbacks\u2019 lead to 4-2. It was the last baserunner the Diamondbacks would have, as the Rockies retired 17 consecutive batters through the end of the game.\nRockies relievers recorded 15 of those outs, marking the first time in the franchise\u2019s 25-year history the bullpen recorded five perfect innings.\nIt was the eighth consecutive game decided by one run that the Diamondbacks have lost. This season, they\u2019re just 18-28 in one-run games.\nBut the Diamondbacks\u2019 recent misery is not limited to one-run games. Nineteen games ago, they were a first-place team. But their 6-13 stretch has resulted in a five-game swing in the standings, with the Diamondbacks now sitting in third place with 16 games remaining.\nParra smoked the first pitch he saw from Hirano on one hop to Goldschmidt. It came off his bat at 98 mph, and Goldschmidt tried to play the ball to his left on a short hop. He couldn\u2019t do so cleanly.\nAfter a Charlie Blackmon sac bunt, LeMahieu hit a 1-1 fastball, a pitch that Hirano wanted down and away but instead went up and over the plate.\n\u201cIt got away and it was kind of up where he could hit it,\u201d Hirano said, speaking through interpreter Kelvin Kondo.\nIt was the eighth time the Diamondbacks\u2019 bullpen had suffered a loss in the past 15 games.",
    "wm_text": " Over that stretch, Hirano has served up five home runs, posting a 5.60 ERA and a 1.48 WHIP in 13 1/3 innings of work.\n\u201cThe one thing about the bullpen is it\u2019s hard to keep everyone fresh,\u201d manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cSometimes the outings go a little longer than you expect to. You have to make quick decisions as far as who\u2019s going to finish. It\u2019s never easy to make those decisions, whether it\u2019s in the sixth inning or the ninth inning. The results are not always what you hope for.\u201d\nDaniel Descalso and Jake Lamb had two hits apiece, extending Descalso\u2019s hitting streak to 13 games, the longest by a Diamondbacks\u2019 player since David Peralta had a 14-game hitting streak in August 2016. The Diamondbacks are now 14-7 in those games, as they\u2019ve gone 15-13 in games Descalso has hit safely.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing them the whole game and getting lucky the whole game,\u201d Descalso said. \u201cIf there was one guy that was going to come through, it\u2019s going to be Jake or me. I just got lucky today, I guess. I\u2019ve felt good the whole time, so hopefully I can keep this rolling.\u201d\nHirano\u2019s struggles are a result of the same things the Diamondbacks have been experiencing since the beginning of the season. The Diamondbacks\u2019 starting rotation has gotten beat in the middle of games, leaving them with bullpen games that are often executed poorly.\nTheir bullpen is managing to keep the games close, but they\u2019re tired by the time they\u2019ve recorded their next win, which Lovullo expects to come.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not scoring runs,",

He allowed two runs on six hits. He struck out eight and walked three. But his quest for his 14th victory was thwarted by a bullpen that has been decimated by injuries, particularly to Hirano and Brad Boxberger, who made his first appearance since his own rehab stint with Class A Visalia on Monday.\nHirano allowed three runs in an inning. Boxberger blew a save when he allowed a leadoff walk and a bloop single in the eighth inning of a 9-8, 13-inning loss in San Diego.\nBOXBEERER COULD COME BACK\nThe Diamondbacks are hopeful that Brad Boxberger will be able to come off the disabled list in the next three days.\n\u201cThe reports have been really positive,\u201d Lovullo said.\nThe Diamondbacks are hoping Boxberger, who has been on the DL with shoulder tendinitis, can come back and pitch a couple of innings in a game before coming off the DL.\nBOXBEERGER\u2019S OUTING\nBoxberger pitched an inning for Visalia on Monday, striking out the side.\n\u201cHe threw the ball very well,\u201d Diamondbacks pitching coach Mike Butcher said. \u201cHe threw some very competitive pitches and felt really good.

This would work beautifully for any family feast or romantic, intimate dinner.\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Cut the squash in half through the stem and lay the halves cut side down on the oiled baking sheet. Bake 50-60 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Scoop out seeds and fibers and discard, then spoon the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash squash with a potato-masher until smooth, then add breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, honey, thyme, rosemary, chopped sage, and orange zest. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm the olive oil and nut oil over medium heat in a small frying pan and add hazelnuts or walnuts. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until nuts are golden. Transfer nuts to a plate and set aside.\n3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan until it turns brown and begins to smoke, 3-4 minutes. Remove immediately from heat, add nutmeg, and set aside.\n4. Place a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Spoon mounds of filling on the sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart (the number of mounds you make will depend on the size of the pasta sheets you use). Lightly mist the mounds with a spray mister filled with water, then place a second pasta sheet over the first, covering the filling mounds, and pressing firmly around the edges and between the mounds to seal. Using a fluted cutting wheel or knife, cut between the rows of ravioli. Repeat with remaining sheets of pasta and filling.\n5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli and cook until tender, 2-3 minutes. To serve, reheat the browned butter. Drain ravioli and place in warmed serving bowl. Toss with butter, sprinkle with hazelnuts and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Garnish with sage leaves and serve immediately.\nInspired by Williams-Sonoma Seasonal Celebration: Autumn, by Joanne Weir (Time-Life Books, 1997).",

(WLFI) \u2014 Wildlife rehibilators said 88 more pigeons were found at an I-65 rest stop where 57 others were dumped in December.\n\"It's a crazy situation,\" said Kim Hoover with Hoots to Howls Wildlife Rehabilitation.\nHoover was notified of the dumping on Feb. 28. An attendant at the White County rest stop on northbound I-65 called her. Hoover said nine boxes, identical to those found in December, were filled with pigeons in a dumpster. Four of the 88 pigeons were found dead, Hoover said.\nThe discovery now makes 145 pigeons found dumped in the same dumpster. Indiana State Police recovered 57 pigeons on Dec. 10. Hoover never thought she would see another situation like this again.\n\"I thought it was a rare act, never happen again, once in a lifetime as heart wrenching as it was then it happens two months later and you're like really?\" she said.\nUnlike the December discovery where the birds were buried in the dumpster, this flock was found on top of trash. Hoover said likely, they were dumped overnight between Feb. 27 and Feb. 28.\n\"They're gorgeous birds,\" said Hoover. \"These are some of the prettiest pigeons I've ever seen. It just stinks.\"\nShe said pigeon enthusiasts reached out to her and helped fill in some of the blanks. The pigeons found in the dumpster are Parlor Roller pigeons. They are bred for their ability to somersault on the ground. People roll them on the ground in competitions to see how far they can go. Click here and go to the 3:03 minute mark to see these rolling birds in action.\nThere are pigeon clubs who compete with these birds humanely, but Hoover believes these dumpster pigeons were part of an illegal gambling ring and were abused. She said both times she came to resuce the birds, they had parasites on them and the boxes they were in did not have breathing holes.\n\"There's a lot of money being made and I am told that this fellow could care less about fines because he knows they won't get in trouble,\" she said.\nHoover said the birds found recently had the same tags on them as the ones found in December. The tags had the name and phone number of a Dublin, Ohio man. News 18 attempted to make calls to the number provided and it has been disconnected. The fact that the man is located out of state is causing problems for who is responsible to help.\n\"The animal control of Dublin Ohio which is where they come from say they were dumped in Indiana and Indiana is like well they came from Ohio,\" said Hoover.\nHoover said she is worried that this has happened at this rest stop other times but unfortunately, those birds were not found in time. She suggested the rest stop get security cameras, but found out that the state won't fund it.\nWildlife centers in Valparaiso and Illinois took a majority of the birds from Hoover. She has 11 left in her care. She said she has received offers of help from other people as well, which she is thankful for. So what's next for the birds?\n\"They have got to get their health up and hopefully then adopted out,\" she said. \"They are trying to find people who understand the birds and you don't want them to go back into the same situation they came from.\"",
    "wm_text": "\nSo far, none of the birds have been adopted out. If you are interested in adoption, Hoover said you would have to have someone come see the birds and take them from her. If you are interested in adopting, call Hoots to Howls at 812-398-4495.",

Subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher and anywhere else you listen to podcasts.\nThe day before President Trump\u2019s rambling Rose Garden remarks announcing a national emergency on our southern border, I sat down with Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). All that was needed was for Congress to vote on the budget deal to avert another government shutdown and send the legislation to Trump\u2019s desk for his signature. And Bass was clear-eyed about what Trump\u2019s theater was masking.\nBass\u2019s first visit to the podcast came just months after Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017. A time when the Los Angeles Democrat said her town halls had turned her into a \u201cpolitical therapist.\u201d That all changed, Bass said, when she put anxiety into action.\nSo I asked Bass, who was part of a small CBC delegation that met with the president in March 2017, how successful the caucus could be in thwarting him and achieving its goals with Trump in the White House. \u201cWith 55 people and the amount of power that we have on a committee and subcommittee level, it\u2019s all very doable,\u201d she said. CBC members now chair the committees on homeland security, financial services, oversight and reform, education and labor, and science, space and technology.\nListen to the podcast to hear Bass talk more about Trump, the Democratic Party and her thoughts on the freshman House member everyone can\u2019t seem to stop talking about: \u201cAOC,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).",

Jerry Brown had insisted on having the reserve limit in the bill, which was a little surprising.\nIt not only defied common sense by potentially forcing local districts to spend down financial reserves against their will, but clearly violated Brown\u2019s own oft-voiced principles of \u201csubsidiarity\u201d \u2013 leaving decisions in local hands \u2013 and building reserves as prudent hedges.\nIt was clearly a sop to the powerful California Teachers Association and other unions which might have otherwise opposed Proposition 2, which was to be the focal point of Brown\u2019s re-election campaign.\nForcing districts to spend down reserves could potentially free money for salary negotiations. Thus, placing the reserve limit in SB 858 would, it appeared, persuade union leaders to not oppose Proposition 2\u2019s passage and give them cover vis-\u00e0-vis their own members \u2013 even though it\u2019s unlikely that conditions for invoking the limit will be met in the foreseeable future, and school officials could probably sidestep it with creative budget-writing.\nAs the Legislature reconvened this week, the California School Boards Association demanded repeal of the limit, citing a study saying it could force districts to spend as much as $17 billion, including emergency reserves, against their better judgment.\n\u201cThis is bad law and needs to be repealed,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Josephine Lucey, declared.\nIt may have been an acceptable tradeoff to Brown, ever the pragmatist willing to set aside even his principles when political exigencies intrude. But it\u2019s still bad public policy and he has dropped hints that with Proposition 2 now passed, he might entertain repealing or modifying it.\nHowever, a Brown flip-flop, if it happens, would make the whole episode look even more cynically manipulative and would also present a political dilemma for the unions.",

The educational establishment won\u2019t necessarily relish having to return to its good-government ways, either.\nBut if the Legislature decides to drop Brown\u2019s last-minute amendments, it would make it look as if he and the Legislature had been in cahoots to rob the kids of the funds the initiative would have promised them.",

Brown, of course, has the ultimate say on the amount of the bond money that the state would be willing to pay.\nBrown is staring down a recession and will be forced to make tough decisions. He\u2019s already shown some reluctance in making cuts and is no fan of higher taxes. However, if the economy worsens and the state\u2019s revenue takes a dive, the unions will be forced to campaign against Proposition 2 if they want money to pay down their reserves.\nNow is the time for Brown to show a little foresight and make more responsible fiscal decisions.",

No problems all these years. Not even a kidney infecion. Congratulations to Lisa for her generosity and good future health to Michael!!!\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 6:03 p.m.\nI've known Lisa for many years and this doesn't surprise me in the least. Yeah Lisa!\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 3:15 p.m.\nThis is certainly an amazing gift. Usually it is a relative who does this. But, if something happens to her one-good kidney, then what? She also has 3 children.\nThu, Mar 15, 2012 : 1:41 a.m.\nThe fear you express in this question is one many people have. Part of the reason that I hear people asking this question is that folks are really unaware of basic biology. It's really uncommon for something to happen to &quot;one&quot; kidney. The most likely thing to have happen to one kidney, is to be born without it. Donating doesn't have a mathematically significant impact upon the donor.\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 5:20 p.m.\nHarry, I am an organ donor but maybe some people have religious objections? I just hope that people will consider doing it.\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 3:51 p.m.\nHopefully there are people who are as generous as she is. One thing I will never understand. Why isn't every person in america an organ donor. Your dead why would you want to be buried with your organs?\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 2:29 p.m.\nNow here is a hero. Its not her job. She's not getting paid. We seem to throw around that word a lot these days.\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 2:27 p.m.",
    "wm_text": "\nSo now she has two kidneys and a life with more happiness. I can't wait to read about her great success and how she is helping others. I don't care if it was the right thing to do. I certainly don't mind reading the story.\nTue, Mar 13, 2012 : 9:46 p.m.\nI hope everyone learns from her example. I know I will.\nTue, Mar 13, 2012 : 9:32 p.m.\nVery inspirational..\nTue, Mar 13, 2012 : 9:16 p.m.\nWOW! That is one generous person. You got a great thing there, Lisa. I hope that your co-worker and her family are able to enjoy it. I would love to do the same for my sister. I know she would be thrilled. I just need to find a good match, as her blood type does not match. I'm sad for people like you, that cannot give, but you are doing the right thing, which in my book makes you even better than one who would give freely but can't. I hope I never have to need you, Lisa. God bless you. I know that you are a good person in every way. I'm glad to hear. I hope everyone can find that quality in themselves too. I'm sure many of us already do.\nTue, Mar 13, 2012 : 7:52 p.m.\nWow! Congrats Lisa! That is awesome! I'm saving this article to encourage my kids to be as giving as their mom! Thanks for sharing!\nTue, Mar 13, 2012 : 4:31 p.m.\nWow! This is inspiring to hear. I don't believe many people are able to do this. Lisa, well done. I'm sure she made her husband happy and you, that was impressive. I would hope we are all like you, helping others out when we can. Perhaps, there is",

He hoped to keep Sicily from the heirs of Frederick II, whom the council of Lyon excommunicated in 1245, because Urban wanted to restore papal influence in Italy. In 1263, he negotiated with Louis IX of France to put Louis' brother Charles of Anjou on the throne of Sicily. Urban died the following year before the treaty was signed.",
    "wm_text": "\n\nUrban dropped his anti-Latin plans after his election; he urged Louis to end the French civil war and the civil wars in Germany and Italy. He was popular because he spared French nobles from the Inquisition and issued a bull about Albigensianism in which he condemned the Franciscans, who claimed to follow the orders of St. Francis of Assisi. He probably was to return to Paris, where he taught canon law and law and politics at the university of Paris, when, on 8 April 1270, he died of the plague in his home in Paris. He is buried with his mother at V\u00e9zelay. He is also the subject of the 11th-century composer, Robert de Saint-Pierre, who composed Masses in his honour in Paris. The most famous painting of him is by Jacques-Louis David, Saint Urban (1832).\n\nUrban is most famous for his statement on the papacy, \"If the pope speaks, he speaks with the voice of the whole church.\" He is also renowned for his statement on the Holy Spirit, stating, \"He has no power whatsoever, unless he manifests it to the Church, or she makes it manifest in her.\"",

It had been reported for much of Friday that Nancy taught at the school \u2014 and that Adam may have targeted children in her classroom \u2014 but that hypothesis got much murkier late Friday night.\nA former school board official in Newtown called into question earlier reports that Nancy Lanza had been connected to Sandy Hook Elementary School, possibly as part of the teaching staff.\n\"No one has heard of her,\" said Lillian Bittman, who served on the local school board until 2011. \"Teachers don't know her.\"\nAt least one parent said Lanza's mother was a substitute teacher there. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the law enforcement official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.\nThe New York Times' updated story still identifies Lanza as a teacher at the school, as does the Washington Post, which calls her a kindergarten teacher at Sandy Hook. The Stamford Advocate, meanwhile, cites a source that echoes that Lanza was indeed a substitute teacher there.\nThis should be cleared up in the morning \u2014 or not.",

Adam, who was 20 years old, and his mother had a \"close, but not intimate\" relationship, a law enforcement official told the Times.\nAdam was shot and killed by police at the school after he opened fire with a semi-automatic Bushmaster AR-15 in his mother's home, in what police said was a premeditated massacre.\n\nIn the aftermath of the massacre, Nancy Lanza was identified by multiple reports as the shooter's mother, or the shooter's girlfriend.\nThe New York Post is now trying to correct its story, saying it hadn't been able to confirm the suspect's mother's affiliation with Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nThe New York Post now says that Adam Lanza's mother was not a Sandy Hook teacher, according to two sources who are familiar with the ongoing investigation.\nThe Post originally described Nancy Lanza, the mother the 20-year-old gunman, as a kindergarten teacher at Sandy Hook, where 20 children and six adults were gunned down.\n\nThe New York Post is now saying that",
