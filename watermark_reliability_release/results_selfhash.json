    "text": "What made you a music director? As a Bengali with an MBBS degree, did you never feel the pressure to pursue a medical career?\nThere is always pressure on you while taking risks. Opposition from family and society is natural. I guess that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds how the society reacts. But some of us are just not made to follow the societal norms. My immense love for music coupled with my adamant nature didn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt let me settle for anything apart from music. For me, music is like medicine.\nDespite hailing from Kolkata, you never thought of composing for Bengali films.\nOf course I do. I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd love to work with Srijit Mukherji and Kaushik Ganguly.\nHow much are you clued in to Bengali film music?\nI left Kolkata around eight years back and Bengali film music has come a long way since then. I love Anupamda\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds (Roy) songwriting and compositions. He is brilliant. The song Ek baar bol tor keu nei is one of my favourites.\nHeard you used to fight with your mother as a kid because you were forced to learn Rabindrasangeet?\nOh yes! Protidin ma er sanghe jhogra hotoh gaan sekha niye! But now Rabindrasangeet is my fave. There are times when I just sit quietly and listen to the songs. During my college days, I used to love rock. Fossils was at its peak then. I grew up listening to Kabir Suman, Anjan Dutt and so on.\nDo you catch up with your old friends whenever you come down to Kolkata?\nI do meet my school friends when I come here. Right now, Kolkata seems to be brimming with joy as Durga Puja is just weeks away. But sadly, I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm going to miss it this time as I would be out of the country for work. What I will miss the most are pandal-hopping and eating out in the wee hours.\nAre you in touch with other Bengali music directors based in Mumbai?\nOf course. I have known Pritamda very well since I was nominated for my debut in Jism2 and for my second film, Yaariyan. I was lucky to score the soundtrack along with him, Mithoon and YoYo Honey Singh. We won the best music award for it too. Pritamda is very warm and often invites us over to his house. Jeetda (Gannguli) is like family to me. His wife is my mom\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds student and they are the sweetest people on earth. We often hang out in a group for adda where we don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt talk work. I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt know Shantanu Moitra personally, but whenever we meet he is extremely encouraging and supportive.\nHow is the competition in Mumbai music industry?\nQuite tough, but fair at the same time. What matters there is your song\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds merit and nothing else.\nMost of your songs, which are also penned by you, are hits. Does that create a pressure on you when you compose your next song?\nThere are certain expectations when you work with big stars and banners. But I take it more as a compliment than a burden.\nWell the list is endless -- my childhood, daily experiences, the people around, my lovers, travelling and imagination.\nWhile promoting Rustom in Kolkata, Akshay Kumar crooned Tere sang yaara, which is composed by you. How does it feel?\nFeels great. He told me that after a long time he has a favourite song. Akshay sir has always been very kind to me. This is the third song I made for him after Meherbaani from The Shaukeens and the title track for a TV show hosted by him called Dare 2 Dance.\nWho are your favourite male and female singers?\nAmong male artistes, it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds Chris Cornell, Eddie Vedder, Bruce Springsteen, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Hemant Mukherjee and Mohammed Rafi to name a few. Among female singers, Lauryn Hill, Adele, Alanis Morissette, Abida Parveen and Shreya Ghoshal are my favourites.\nWhich music director do you like the most?\nMy all-time favourite music director is Hemanta Mukherjee. I am also very fond of Vishal Bhardwaj.\nOne singer you wish to lend voice to your music?\nMy dream is to have Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan or Jagjit Singh lend their voice to music composed by me some day.\nWhich is your favourite composition till date?\nDariya, from an upcoming film starring Katrina Kaif and Sidharth Malhotra. The song conveys the simplest and purest emotion and that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds how music should be.\nAkshay Kumar, Sidharth Malhotra, Irrfan, Randeep Hooda all have lip-synced on your tracks. Any actor you would want to playback for?\nI would like to playback for Ranbir Kapoor. He is one of my favourite actors.",
    "wm_text": " I think he has the potential to make a great playback singer.\nHaving got a chance to work with many great directors and composers, what is one director/composer you wish to collaborate with in the future?\nI would love to work with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Vishal Bhardwaj and A R Rahman in the future.",

    "text": "He was in the airline business. He was American. And he knew his golf.\nYou know, he said, the American golfer who makes a first foray across the Atlantic typically goes to Scotland first.\nThen the golfer goes to Ireland.\nThis, of course, begged the question: why?\nI\u2019ll attempt to answer, but first an admission.\nI am biased because I am from Ireland and much of my youth was spent of golf courses there, one in particular, where my dad and other family members enjoyed membership.\nThat said, I am also objective enough to know that in writing about Ireland as one of the planet\u2019s prime golf destinations I am on very firm ground indeed, anything but a voice in the wilderness, or the rough.\nAnd here\u2019s another thing. I have played the game all over the United States and that includes Hawaii.\nI have walked the walk at the likes of Augusta National and Pinehurst. I have cast an admiring eye over Pebble Beach.\nAnd yet I still close my eyes and imagine a fair Irish day on a green Irish fairway.\nI also imagine better shots than I\u2019m capable of hitting, but that\u2019s another story.\nAt the end of this homage to Irish golf - being penned just days before the U.S. Open in a place called Erin Hills (Wisconsin) no less - I will repeat what has been said to me by more than one American golfer, this with regard to where arguably the most spectacular golf course on planet earth can be found.\nIt\u2019s an Irish course\u2026of course.\nAnd, yes, this is a subjective point of view. It\u2019s really impossible to rate a course as being \u201cbest\u201d in the world. But \u201cspectacular\u201d leaves a little more wiggle room.\nAnd, as stated, the affirming with regard to this particular course opinion has been directed at yours truly more than once.\nI have not played this course, but have played a fair few other Irish courses that certainly rate in global terms.\nSo let\u2019s take a little trip around the island and name a few.\nFirst up though, it\u2019s important to note that golf, along with a number of other sports, is an all island affair in terms of governance.\nThere is no border in Irish golf.\nThis fact led to all the ballyhoo a while back regarding Rory McIlroy and whether he would represent Ireland or Great Britain in the Olympics.\nHe didn\u2019t play in the games, but had he done so it would have been for Ireland.\nRory is a pivotal figure in Irish golf in more ways than one.\nHis foundation is a prime sponsor of the Irish Open, this year being played in Portstewart, County Derry in early July.\nMcIlroy\u2019s success in golf majors, along with that of Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, both from Northern Ireland, has been instrumental in the decision to bring The Open to Royal Portrush, just down the road from Portstewart, in 2019.\nPadraig Harrington\u2019s name being twice inscribed on the Claret Jug is also a factor.\nThis return of The Open to the Antrim coast draws a link back to 1951 when the oldest of golf\u2019s majors was played there and won by Max Faulkner, a player remembered for his preference for plus fours instead of golfing slacks.\nFaulkner was a standout in more ways than just dress.\nThe story has it that after three rounds through the rolling Portrush dunes, Faulkner was signing autographs that already proclaimed himself as the winner of the tournament.\nTrue, he was six shots up after 54 holes but stranger things have happened. In this case they didn\u2019t.\nI met Max Faulkner when I was a kid.\nHe was playing at that course where I spent so much of my youth, Woodbrook, which straddles the line between Dublin and Wicklow.\nI remember those odd looking plus fours. Faulkner was also a nice guy, or at least a tolerant one as he was being buzzed by whippersnappers like myself eager for player monikers.\nRoyal Portrush and Portstewart rate highly then.\nAnd in Ulster there\u2019s another brace to add to the list of must-plays. Royal County Down for sure, and I have fond memories of a nice stroll around Rosapenna links in County Donegal, a place where you could tee off on the eighteenth at 10.30 on a midsummer\u2019s night and, assuming no diversions into the rough, finish in a manageable gloaming.\nBeing an island, Ireland has an abundance of links courses but also some truly beautiful parkland venues.\nThe K Club in Kildare and Mount Juliet in Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny come to mind.\nIn the case of the latter, there is a claim that this is the best parkland course on the island. Well, it was designed by Jack Nicklaus so that\u2019s an argument that would be difficult to refute.\nDruid\u2019s Glen in County Wicklow is definitely worth a visit. Killarney, which I have battled my way around, is for sure another as is Adare Manor in County Limerick.\nThe aforementioned Woodbrook, which hosted a number of Ireland\u2019s top tournaments in the 1960s and 1970s, is beside the Irish Sea but is rated a parkland course because it is fronted by mud cliffs.\nThe wind has had its wicked way with some of the course trees, not least pines that end up leaning this way and that.\nSometimes, with a quick glance at certain corners of the course, you would actually be reminded a little of Pebble Beach.\nIt is probably fair to say that the American golfer, when thinking in terms of an Irish foray, first and foremost considers a links.\nNo shortage of those of course. From those northern bastions mentioned above come on down the coast stopping at Rosses Point in County Sligo, Lahinch in Clare and also in the Banner County, Doonbeg and its mountainous dunes.\nDoonbeg has Greg Norman\u2019s name on the designer credits. He is reputed to have turned up, cast an eye over the landscape only to proclaim that there was nothing he could do here that God had not already done.\nHaving played Doonbeg, I would confidently second that assertion.\nHaving played it in a fresh Atlantic wind I would throw in the devil himself for good measure.\nDown the coast a bit there is mighty, and mighty famous, Ballybunion with that opening tee shot that invites you to land your ball in a cemetery.\nA fitting metaphor for my game so when I stood on the tee I made sure that I aimed well left of the headstones.\nWaterville in County Kerry is another course to tackle. This was the late great Payne Stewart\u2019s home from home. He used to tend bar in the clubhouse and was proclaimed honorary captain.\nThere is a statue of Stewart at Waterville that is the Irish match for the bronze that can be viewed at Pinehurst in North Carolina.\nThe Waterville website mentions that less than one percent of the world\u2019s golf courses rate as true links courses, and that 85 percent of them can be found in Ireland and Britain.\nWaterville asserts that it is the greatest links in the Republic, while granting the title to Royal County Down in Northern Ireland.\nThere would be argument over that of course, but both courses are for sure prominent in said argument.\nCloser to Dublin there are a fair few fine links tracks, notably Royal Dublin and Portmarnock, while down the coast a bit, in County Wicklow, there is a true gem called the European Club.\nBut what of that as yet unnamed course so beloved by those peripatetic American eyes?\nMany years ago, the great journalist and broadcaster, Alistair Cooke, spun out a tease on television.\nAt the end of the broadcast he promised that he would deliver his verdict on the woman that he believed was the most beautiful in living memory.\nWell, he went this way and that until the very end at which point he proclaimed his belief that the actress Ava Gardner was his one and only.\nSuch a proclamation was certain to inspire debate of course.\nEvery Hollywood star has a fan club. Every great golf course has a fan club.\nAnd Irish golfers will spend many a long evening arguing for this course and that course \u2013 and never quite reach a conclusion.\nBut this assertion is based on the verdict, arguably more objective, of a slew of American golfers who have played this course, or have simply clapped eyes on it, and who have come within earshot of yours truly while announcing their verdict.\nSo this jury is in.\nTo describe it as the \u201cbest\u201d course is not applicable because that invites subjective argument from here to eternity.\nBut to describe this course as being the most stunning sight in the most spectacular setting invites greater consensus.\nSo without further ado\u2026.Well, with just a little because the reader can have a moment to guess.\nThe course in question can be found on a clenched fist of land off the Cork coast.\nI am speaking (of course!) of Old Head.\nThis promontory peach has prompted a unanimity to a degree and pitch that I have not heard applied to any other golf course in Ireland, and from some, the world.\nReaders might beg to differ, but best to do that after playing Old Head which is just a few miles from Kinsale.\nIn a way, Old Head is itself a metaphor for the entire island when it comes to golf.\nIt reaches out into the sea from a much larger landmass, just as Ireland itself sits in the sea off a much larger landmass.\nBoth metaphor and reality share their other worldly and spectacular natures.\nAnd that\u2019s beyond any argument in any club house bar.\nWe will be reminded of this very soon with the Irish Open at Portstewart, and again two years from now when The Open returns to Royal Portrush.\nFinally, back to that question at the top: Scotland, Ireland, Ireland again. Why?\nNow that\u2019s a tough one but I suspect that the \u201ccraic,\u201d as they say, might just be a little mightier in Hibernia than Caledonia.\nOne to argue over a wee dram ... of Irish, of course.",

    "text": "For professors, publishing in elite journals is an unavoidable part of university life. The grueling process of subjecting work to the up-or-down judgment of credentialed scholarly peers has been a cornerstone of academic culture since at least the mid-20th century.\nNow some humanities scholars have begun to challenge the monopoly that peer review has on admission to career-making journals and, as a consequence, to the charmed circle of tenured academe. They argue that in an era of digital media there is a better way to assess the quality of work. Instead of relying on a few experts selected by leading publications, they advocate using the Internet to expose scholarly thinking to the swift collective judgment of a much broader interested audience.\nThat transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming fall issue \u2014 one that will make it, Ms. Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.\nMixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts \u2014 what Ms. Rowe called \u201cour crowd sourcing\u201d \u2014 were invited to post their signed comments on the Web site MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterly\u2019s editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out Sept. 17.\nThe Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialized experts.\nToday a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.\nThe quarterly\u2019s experiment has so far inspired at least one other journal \u2014 Postmedieval \u2014 to plan a similar trial for next year.\nJust a few years ago these sorts of developments would have been unthinkable, said Dan Cohen, director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. \u201cSerious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy \u2014 as they have existed for decades, even centuries \u2014 aren\u2019t becoming obsolete,\u201d he said.\nEach type of review has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe traditional method, in which independent experts evaluate a submission, often under a veil of anonymity, can take months, even years.\nClubby exclusiveness, sloppy editing and fraud have all marred peer review on occasion. Anonymity can help prevent personal bias, but it can also make reviewers less accountable; exclusiveness can help ensure quality control but can also narrow the range of feedback and participants. Open review more closely resembles Wikipedia behind the scenes, where anyone with an interest can post a comment. This open-door policy has made Wikipedia, on balance, a crucial reference resource.\nMs. Rowe said the goal is not necessarily to replace peer review but to use other, more open methods as well.\nIn some respects scientists and economists who have created online repositories for unpublished working papers, like repec.org, have more quickly adapted to digital life. Just this month, mathematicians used blogs and wikis to evaluate a supposed mathematical proof in the space of a week \u2014 the scholarly equivalent of warp speed.\nIn the humanities, in which the monograph has been king, there is more inertia. \u201cWe have never done it that way before,\u201d should be academia\u2019s motto, said Kathleen Fitzpatrick, a professor of media studies at Pomona College.\nMs. Fitzpatrick was a founder of the MediaCommons network in 2007. She posted chapters of her own book \u201cPlanned Obsolescence\u201d on the site, and she used the comments readers provided to revise the manuscript for NYU Press. She also included the project in the package she presented to the committee that promoted her to full professor this year.\nMany professors, of course, are wary of turning peer review into an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d-like competition. They question whether people would be as frank in public, and they worry that comments would be short and episodic, rather than comprehensive and conceptual, and that know-nothings would predominate.\nAfter all, the development of peer review was an outgrowth of the professionalization of disciplines from mathematics to history \u2014 a way of keeping eager but uninformed amateurs out.\n\u201cKnowledge is not democratic,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Lamont, a Harvard sociologist who analyzes peer review in her 2009 book, \u201cHow Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment.\u201d Evaluating originality and intellectual significance, she said, can be done only by those who are expert in a field.\nThe most daunting obstacle to opening up the process is that peer-review publishing is the path to a job and tenure, and no would-be professor wants to be the academic canary in the coal mine.\nAlthough initially cautious, Mr. Galey said he is now \u201centirely won over by the open peer review model.\u201d The comments were more extensive and more insightful, he said, than he otherwise would have received on his essay, which discusses Shakespeare in the context of information theory.\nAdvocates of more open reviewing, like Mr. Cohen at George Mason argue that other important scholarly values besides quality control \u2014 for example, generating discussion, improving works in progress and sharing information rapidly \u2014 are given short shrift under the current system.\n\u201cThere is an ethical imperative to share information,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, who regularly posts his work online, where he said thousands read it. Engaging people in different disciplines and from outside academia has made his scholarship better, he said.",

The fear that people simply won\u2019t bother to read or comment on articles without the assurance of an editor\u2019s stamp springs full grown to the surface of academic concern.\nFor example, in an essay posted on the Shakespeare Quarterly Web site, a Harvard professor of Shakespeare wrote that the project was \u201cnot a good idea\u201d: \u201cPeer review is the one philosophic instrument that scholars and academics have devised to preserve the rigor, seriousness and value of scholarly writing.\u201d\nAnother professor from a prestigious university, writing on e-readers, said: \u201cI am a professional who has real concerns about the debasement of scholarly scholarship and the creation of a new kind of plagiarism.\u201d\nMs. Rowe, who is in her early 30s and is not yet a professor, was undaunted by the reaction of the established academics.\n\u201cShould we be concerned about this? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Ms. Rowe said. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\nIn the end, she said, it is the scholars who are the ultimate judges.\n\u201cPeer review is the core of the scholarly enterprise, why we write and why we care about the work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cwe do have this question about whether it\u2019s the best way.\u201d\n\nReferring to serious critics of the new procedure as \u201camateurs\u201d is an insult.

    "text": "Under intense pressure to improve conditions in the jail complex on Rikers Island, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio has developed a plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds to a dedicated jail for youths in the Bronx.\nThe cost to carry out the plan is expected to be about $300 million, officials said.\nThe plan calls for the city to reconfigure the Horizon Juvenile Center, which is currently used to hold 14- and 15-year olds, to house the 16- and 17-year olds who are typically sent to Rikers.\nA 2015 settlement with the Department of Justice on reform at Rikers called on the city to seek an alternative location to house inmates under 18, although it stopped short of requiring it.\nNew York is the only state other than North Carolina that prosecutes all children 16 and older as adults if they are accused of a crime. In New York City, they are likely to wind up at Rikers, a notoriously brutal lockup. There are currently about 200 inmates who are 16 or 17 at Rikers, down from about 330 in 2013.\nThe city and many advocates have urged state lawmakers to pass a law that would treat those under the age of 18 as juveniles, but the proposal has gone nowhere in Albany.\nThe new plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds from Rikers must overcome several hurdles. It has to be approved through the city\u2019s time-consuming land use process: The local community board and the Bronx borough president get to weigh in and it must be approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council.\nBut the change will not happen any time soon; officials said it could take four years or more to get approvals and to complete construction. The plan also calls for the city to remodel another juvenile detention site, the Crossroads Juvenile Center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to hold all of the city\u2019s 14- and 15-year-old detainees, including those who had previously gone to Horizon.\nThe cost of refurbishing the Bronx center is budgeted at $170 million. The cost of remodeling the Brooklyn center is budgeted at $129 million.\nAdvocates supported the move but lamented the long delay before the new center will be ready, assuming that it survives the land-use review process.\n\u201cFor us this is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d he said.\nMore than 95 percent of the 16- and 17-year-olds at Rikers are awaiting trial. More than a third have been charged with robbery and about one in 10 have been charged with assault, according to data provided by the city.\nIncreased attention was focused on the plight of younger teenagers at Rikers in 2014 after The New Yorker published an article about Kalief Browder, who was sent there at 16, accused of stealing a backpack. He never stood trial or was found guilty of any crime but he spent three years at Rikers, nearly two of them in solitary confinement. He told of being beaten repeatedly by guards and other inmates and trying several times to kill himself while in custody. After his release he remained deeply troubled by the experience and he committed suicide last year at age 22.\nThe city ended solitary confinement for Rikers inmates under 18 in December 2014.",

The administration has instead opted to move 16- and 17-year-olds to the Bronx.\nSome city lawmakers said the latest proposal was not enough.\n\u201cThis is just the latest failed attempt to fix broken institutions \u2014 not the only one \u2014 and it is no substitute for real reforms,\u201d said Councilman Robert Holden, who has pushed for reforms along with Councilman Donovan Richards and other lawmakers.\n\u201cThis plan is backward,\u201d he added.\nBut Holden said he would work with the administration and the council members to make sure it is the best possible option for the 16- and 17-year-olds held at Rikers.\nPeter J.

    "text": "WASHINGTON -- With television lights glaring, 20 lawmakers will gather next week to revisit the fight that consumed Congress before Christmas over renewing a Social Security payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits.\nLittle real work will be done, but the meeting will mark the formal start of an effort to untangle a dispute that both parties want to resolve, though for different reasons. Following is a look at the path Round 2 could take, based on interviews with participants on both sides.\nQ: Can you remind me what's at stake?\nA: After a bitter clash and just a week before a New Year's Day deadline, President Barack Obama and Congress renewed a 2 percentage point payroll tax cut for 160 million workers and benefits for the long-term unemployed through February. They also temporarily forestalled a deep cut in doctors' Medicare fees that threatened to make it harder for the elderly to find physicians who would treat them. Now, the two sides need to figure out how to extend all three measures through 2012 and cover the roughly $160 billion cost.\nQ: Are they expected to succeed?\nA: Yes, though it will probably take until shortly before the current extensions expire Feb. 29. There are complicated decisions ahead, chiefly what programs to cut and what fees to increase to offset the price tag. Just as important, Democrats won't be in a hurry to finish.\nA: Republicans took a severe pounding in December when the House GOP resisted a bipartisan, Senate-approved, two-month extension of the payroll tax cut, which was designed to give lawmakers time to negotiate a longer version. With control of the White House and Congress at stake in the November elections, many Democrats think the GOP could incur further damage if these latest talks take time.\nMany Republicans doubt the economic benefit of a payroll tax cut, a foundation of Obama's plan to create jobs. But as December's battle unfolded, GOP leaders worried that they would suffer political damage from opposing the deeply popular tax cut, worth $1,000 annually to a family earning $50,000 a year.\nWith the House's fractious conservative wing balking until the very end, the fight made the GOP look like it was opposing the tax reduction -- which Democrats contrasted with Republican support for tax breaks for the wealthy. Most Republicans want this year's fight to end quickly so they can change the subject to their own efforts to cut taxes, federal spending and Obama administration regulations.\nQ: How long can Democrats prolong the negotiations?\nA: If they're not careful they could overplay their hand.\nDemocrats scored points last year by forcing Senate votes on their proposal to finance the payroll tax cut with a small surtax on people earning $1 million or more a year. They have a new incentive to do something similar this year with the GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, a wealthy venture capitalist, being cast by party rivals as callous and out of touch.\nAs a result, many Democrats want to begin this year's talks on extending the Social Security tax cut by targeting the wealthy for a tax increase, perhaps with the millionaire surtax or by limiting their deductions. The millionaire surtax has no chance of passage in the GOP-run House, and Democrats could be accused of blatantly playing politics. Democrats and Obama have a reason to cut a deal: They believe extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits will goose the economy and reduce the risk of another economic downturn that could hurt their election prospects.\nQ; What will the 20 members of Congress do?\nA: House and Senate party leaders each have appointed bargainers to hash out differences over the bill, following Congress' tradition of naming conference committees to craft compromise legislation. But as usual when high-profile battles are being resolved, party leaders will have tight control over the ultimate deal. Still, conference committee members will play a role in writing details, and their endorsement of a package would let leaders argue that they didn't jam something down the throats of rank-and-file lawmakers.\nQ: Who are these 20 lawmakers?\nA: They range from formidable committee chairmen to lowly freshmen, but each has a stake in the fight.\nThe chairmen of Congress' two tax-writing committees are included: Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., of the Senate Finance Committee.\nSen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., is the Senate's No. 2 Republican and a close ally of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, facing re-election this fall in the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, has repeatedly been given a visible role in the payroll tax fight by party leaders.\nRep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., a party leader, should be a leading opponent of Republican proposals to help finance the plan by effectively denying the child tax credit to many illegal immigrants. Freshman GOP Rep. Nan Hayworth is from a closely contested district in New York's Hudson River Valley.\nHayworth and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., are doctors, which could give them roles in the talks involving Medicare. A pair of Maryland Democrats, Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, are sure to battle a Republican proposal to make federal employees contribute more to their pensions.\nQ: Do they bring other experience to the bargaining table?\nA: Seven have participated in recent, failed bipartisan efforts to contain mammoth budget deficits. Those were Congress' supercommittee, talks led by Vice President Joe Biden, the \"Group of Six\" senators, and a presidential commission headed by former Wyoming GOP Sen. Alan Simpson and former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, Erskine Bowles.\nNone of those groups succeeded, largely because party leaders could not agree to the controversial tax increases and cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare that would have been required for the trillions of dollars in savings needed.\nFar smaller savings are needed to resolve the payroll tax fight, and the consensus is that this time, the president and leaders in both parties want a package that can become law.",
    "wm_text": "\nBut lawmakers who took part in the failed, bipartisan negotiations say their experiences make them skeptical that this time will be any different.\n\"We have to consider the experience of the past year,\" said Baucus, who joined four other senators who wanted the Social Security changes in December's compromise legislation before postponing them to January.\n\"We have to make sure that all the players have to give to get what they want,\" Baucus said. \"And there's no guarantee that's the case.\"\n\u00a9 2011 Associated Press.

    "no_wm_text": "\nSo lawmakers likely will be searching for ways to avoid the kind of impasse that has characterizes so many prior deficit-reduction efforts.\nQ: What's the biggest sticking point?\nA: All sides are hoping for a way to finance the payroll tax cut and unemployed benefits for workers who make less than $110,100 annually -- but not at the same time. Republicans are demanding to delay the tax cut for two months, while Democrats want to extend the benefit for a full year.\nNo matter what compromise emerges, it's likely to be opposed by at least one of the three groups that may be most important to its success.\nHouse Republicans likely won't approve any plan that involves taxing the wealthy. Minority Leader Pelosi, D-Calif., has vowed that most Democrats won't vote for a deal that doesn't include restoring the full payroll tax cut, and she says she wants the Democratic conference to vote on a final plan before it comes to the House floor for a vote.\nSenate Democrats -- who initially wanted a two-year extension of all three measures -- will demand that any plan to replace the expired tax cut for workers with 2.1 million or more dependents also extend jobless benefits for long-term unemployed workers.\nMany Democrats and Republicans think it would be politically smart to reach a long-term agreement to extend both the Social Security payroll tax cut and jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed, a group of about 2.6 million people. But it's likely to be difficult to reach a deal on long-term unemployment benefits that breaks sharply with the political mood in both parties.\nEconomists say that is because the relief payments provided to those jobless workers have prevented them from turning to the welfare system, and because enhanced unemployment payments have helped lift the unemployment rate to a four-year low of 8.3 percent.\nQ: What would happen if the talks collapse again?\nA: That's hard to predict.\nCongress",

    "text": "WASHINGTON - WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal regulators voted Wednesday to require companies to reveal more information about how they pay their executives amid a public outcry over compensation.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4-to-1 to expand the disclosure requirements for public companies.\nCompany policies that encouraged excessive risk-taking and rewarded executives for delivering short-term profits were blamed for fueling the financial crisis.\nThe SEC also changed a formula that critics say allowed companies to understate how much their senior executives are paid. At issue is how public companies report stock options and stock awards in regulatory filings. Such awards often make up most of top executives' pay.\nThe new requirements include information on how a company's pay policies might encourage too much risk-taking.\nSeparately, the agency voted unanimously to require thousands of investment advisers who have custody of clients' money to submit to annual surprise exams by outside auditors.\nThe surprise audits would allow independent accountants to review the books and verify that the money is there. The snap audits would apply to about 1,600 investment advisers that don't use third-party custodians, out of roughly 11,000 advisers registered with the SEC.\nThis move is aimed at plugging gaps that allowed disgraced money manager Bernard Madoff to deceive investors.\nThe expanded executive pay disclosure rules will take effect next spring, when companies send annual proxy disclosures to shareholders.\nThe changes will help investors make better-informed voting decisions for the companies in which they hold stock, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said.\n\"By adopting these rules, we will improve the disclosure around risk, compensation and corporate governance, thereby increasing accountability and directly benefiting investors,\" Schapiro said before the vote.\nBut Commissioner Kathleen Casey said she opposed some of the new requirements, such as added information on qualifications of directors and candidates for the board, that she said could be \"unduly burdensome.\"\nAs a result, Casey said she was voting against the rule as a whole.\nIt was the first final rule adopted by the SEC this year under Schapiro's tenure. Numerous proposals have been made by the commissioners.\n\u2014Legal actions involving the company's executive officers, directors and nominees for the board.\n\u2014The role played by diversity as a factor in choosing candidates for the board.\n\u2014Potential conflicts of interest on the part of compensation consultants retained by the company.\nThe Obama administration imposed pay curbs on banks that received federal bailout money. Since then, eight of the largest such banks have either repaid or said they will repay their federal money, largely to escape caps on executive pay.\nThe Federal Reserve has set a February deadline for the 28 biggest U.S. banks \u2014 including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. \u2014 for submitting 2010 compensation plans. The Fed also will be encouraging, though not requiring, banks to revise this year's pay plans if they are out of step with principles the Fed has proposed to limit risk.\nAnger over lavish Wall Street pay has led some U.S. banks to take pre-emptive action. Goldman Sachs, for example, has said it won't give cash bonuses to 30 top executives. Instead, the bonuses will be paid in stock that can't be cashed in for five years.\nCompanies will have to disclose how pay is determined in departments involved in the riskiest activities \u2014 or departments that produce a big chunk of company profits.\nThe new requirements were proposed by the SEC and opened to public comment in July. They build on rules the agency adopted in 2006.\nUnder current rules, companies don't have to reveal the full value of stock options they give an executive. Instead, they must disclose in their annual proxy statements only the portion of an options award that vests that year.\nThe new rule will require companies to show in a summary table the estimated value of all stock-based awards on the day they are granted. The SEC's 2006 rules had relegated those totals to a separate table that investors often overlook or find hard to decipher.\nAn example is the case of a company that decides its CEO deserves $10 million worth of stock options, to vest in equal installments over four years. Under current rules, the company would have to include only $2.5 million \u2014 one-fourth of the total of the $10 million total \u2014 in the summary table.",

Organizers said more than 8,000 people rallied around noon on Wall Street and then walked to Times Square, where they posed for a photograph in front of the famous \"Charging Bull\" statue.\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has called for a federal tax on Wall Street compensation, similar to the one that exists for corporate profits, to help pay for more city services.\nSome companies have responded to the outcry by cutting executive pay or trying to dole out more of it in stock options, which are arguably less susceptible to public backlash.\nMany companies have been taking steps to try to improve corporate accountability and cut incentives for risk-taking.\nReferring to the new disclosure requirements, Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said the enhancements the SEC is proposing are long overdue.\n\"Hopefully, they will create a more sustained focus and attention to pay practices in the corporate world,\" Elson said.",

Blumberg, M.D., Ph.D., winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovery of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), will present a talk on \"The Adventure of Science and Discovery,\" April 16 at 5 p.m. in Butler Auditorium in Farber Hall on the University at Buffalo's South (Main Street) Campus.\nBlumberg has had a major impact on worldwide public health throughout his career. He and his colleagues were responsible for developing the HBV vaccine, which has decreased HBV infection dramatically along with the incidence of liver cancer that can be caused by HBV.\nThe virus is an important cause of disease and death in many populous nations, especially Asia and Africa. The vaccine and the diagnostic tests that followed the discovery of the virus have saved millions of lives.\nBlumberg is a professor of medicine and anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania and Distinguished Scientist at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. More recently, he has been involved in research at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, where he is director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute. The institute concentrates on studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.\nBlumberg will discuss both his work with HBV and his work on astrobiology during his lecture.\nAmong his many affiliations, Blumberg is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\nSponsored by the UB Department of Social and Preventive Medicine (SPM), the lecture is part of the Saxon Graham Lectureship series.\nAn accomplished epidemiologist, Graham chaired the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine from 1981 to 1991. He is known for his important contributions to the understanding of the impact of diet on cancer, many of which were based on studying dietary habits of Western New Yorkers.\nThe department, an integral component of UB's School of Public Health and Health Professions, continues Graham's legacy of using epidemiologic tools in research studies to understand to the causes and prevention of diseases in human populations, especially in the Western New York community.",

    "text": "The Mapes family of Effingham enjoy the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago with their children including their adopted children, Regino and Regina, who were born in the Philippines.\nMisty Mapes and her husband, Patrick, of Effingham always had a desire to add to their family through adoption.\nThat dream became a reality in part due to Gift of Adoption Fund, a nonprofit organization that provides financial support to families that need help to pay for the hefty cost of adopting a child.\nThe Mapes, who have two biological children, Braydon, 16, and Madison, 11, were able to adopt 8-year-old twins, Regina and Regino \u2014 who go by Ina and Ino \u2014 about a year ago from the Philippines. They received a $4,000 grant that helped them pay travel expenses to the Philippines to bring the children home.\nThough they had always had tossed around the idea of adoption, they were spurred to take action when their older son asked them about it a few years ago.\n\"He said, 'Hey. Can we adopt? I'd like to have a brother,\" Misty Mapes recalled.\nMisty Mapes, who works as a teacher, and Patrick, who is a dockworker, set about eliminating as many of their expenses as they could to save the $40,000 they would need to took to fund the adoption.\nThat final boost was provided by the Gift of Adoption Fund, which bridges the game when people are nearing the goal of completing the adoption, but need a little extra financial help to finalize it, said Marcy McKay, a La Grange resident and volunteer for the fund.\nThough they didn't need the financial help to adopt their children that the Gift of Adoption Fund provides, the McKays, who have three adopted children ages 14, 13, and 11, know how costly it is and are working to help other families adopt.\nIn November 2014, Bethany and Jared Crain got a call saying that they were matched with an expectant mother.\nWhile they were ecstatic that they could be adding to their family of three, they decided not to tell their 4-year-old that she could be getting a sibling.\n\"It's just so extremely expensive,\" said McKay. \"A lot of people don't have that kind of money.\"\nThe need on the part of children to have families is great, too. The fund estimates there are 140 million children around the world who are orphaned and 500,000 in the U.S. who are living in foster care and have no permanent family to call their own.\nThe goal of the fund is to inspire adoption by providing grants to qualified parents. Parents who seek grants are required to show that they have financial need and have already completed some of the steps needed to adopt such as working with a licensed agency and having a home study done.\nThe fund puts an emphasis on completing adoptions for children who may find it more difficult to be placed with a permanent family. Those children may be siblings, like Regina and Regino Mapes, children who are aging out, have medical needs or who may go into foster care.\nThe grants that are supplied by the nonprofit range from $3,500 to $7,500.\nJoan Schoon's desire to be a foster parent was born out of compassion and sympathy.\nAs a teenager, she remembers listening to her friends who were foster children complain about treatment they endured in some of their previous foster homes.\n\"They apply for the exact dollar amount they need and the grants are paid directly to the adoption agency,\" McKay said.\nThe fund was founded in 1996 by a couple who, like the McKays, felt thankful that they had the financial resources to pay for adopting children, and wanted to help other families who need the support, according to its website.\nShe said the group raises money through a variety of fundraisers such as cocktail parties and golf outings.\n\"It's such a compelling cause,\" said McKay, noting that many of their donations are in the $50 to $100 ranges.\n\"It's a perfect fit,\" she said.",

    "text": "The write-up \u201cDoctor had thyself\u201d (Spectrum, October 4) took up the issue of professional ethics among doctors. Once sacrosanct Hippocratic Oath has been obscured by the lure of lucre and commission culture.\nAll human concerns and considerations are at stake so much so that each patient is considered a milch-cow. But all this is antithetical to the concept of a welfare state. Healthcare matters more than anything else in India.\nThe government, intelligentsia, law enforcing agencies and charitable organisations must rise to the occasion and curb illegal and undesirable medical practices. The marketing of drugs should be strictly regulated and supervised. Justice should be prompt and deterrent.\nThe role of a doctor in society ought to be consoling, sustaining and elevating in order to revive the erstwhile cordial and courteous bonds in doctor patient relationship. Still a roaring practice laced with milk of human kindness, credibility and self-esteem will bring fame, prestige and money. Introspect deeply and act resolutely.\nVaranasi or Banaras (Spectrum, October 11) was one of the six flourishing places in the days of the Buddha. British resident, Jonathan Duncan established a Sanskrit college there in 1792. Mrs Annie Besant, an activist of the Theosophical Society started Central Hindu School in 1889, which eventually developed into the Banaras Hindu University in 1915.\nWhen the celebrated Vishvanath Temple in the city was demolished and a mosque was built there under the orders of Aurangzeb, poet Chandar Bhan satirically said: \u201cBa-been karaamat-e-butkhaana-e-mara ai Shaikh/Agar kharaab shavad khaana-e-khuda gardad\u201d (See the miracle of my temple. Even after its destruction it remains the abode of God).\nPeerless poet, Mirza Ghalib, visited Varanasi on December 1, 1827. He was so much enamoured with the place that he stayed there for about a month. In his poem Chiraag-e-dair (lamp of temple) he admired the city. It comprises 108 couplets, a lucky number for the Hindus. Their rosaries have 108 beads. The poet, who described Banaras as the Ka\u2019aba of Hindustan, says, a wise man told him that doomsday would not come, as God did not want the destruction of this elegant city.\nThe practice of giving English titles to Hindi movies (\u201cDesi movies English titles\u201d, Spectrum, Sept 27) is not new, as many movies have had English titles throughout the history of Indian cinema. First and foremost comes to mind films like Street Singer and President which had K.L. Saigal as hero. Mother India (1957) made by Mehboob is considered a landmark in Indian cinema.\nGuru Dutt and Madhubala came up with an evergreen musical comedy Mr & Mrs. 55. Raj Kapoor produced \u201cBoot Polish\u201d (1956) bringing out the struggles of street children. Another one was Love in Shimla (1959) which introduced Sadhana as a new face. Evergreen hero Dev Anand starred in many movies with English titles like Taxi Driver, House No. 44, Paying Guest, CID, Love Marriage, Gambler, Jewel Thief and above all his magnum opus Guide (1966).\nIn \u201cRoad to happiness\u201d (Saturday Extra, Sept. 12) the writer has beautifully enumerated eight points to achieve happiness, which has become a rare commodity in this materialistic and selfish world.\nI fully endorse his points. Nathaniel Cotton\u2019s verse, which the writer quoted to buttress his points, was full of wisdom, prudence, reason, sanity and practical knowledge.\nIt is said that sympathy is a heavenly quality and should be shown to everyone in trouble to attain happiness. Kindness, goodness and loving care of one\u2019s aged and ailing parents, contentment and peace of mind, the belief in \u201clive and let live\u201d, \u201clet bygones be bygones\u201d and practice of ahimsa (non-violence) are the key ingredients of happiness. Noble deeds, good food, good thoughts, good conduct devoid of envy, jealousy, rivalry, grudge, malice, back biting and ill-will lead to happiness. The recital of god\u2019s name acts as an icing on the cake.\nLife is a precious gift of God. It is worth living with all its frustrations, impediments and failures. Those who live it as it comes along can solve problems; overcome hardships to achieve their goals and happiness. One should work and not remain idle to be happy. Bad habits like drinking in excess, smoking, taking opium and other such vices should be shunned as these ruin one\u2019s happiness, home and hearth. Punctuality, the mark of civilisation and culture, must be cultivated to gain happiness.\nThinking about common good rather than about one\u2019s own self, caring more for one\u2019s duties than for rights and providing food, water and shelter to the have-nots can increase one\u2019s happiness manifold. To conclude: Happy is the man, whose wish and care, a few paternal acres bound, content to breathe his native air, in his own ground.",

We were not there to make asks, but rather to build consensus around real solutions.\"\nSalt also added that no one raised the issue of Obama overturning the Mexico City Policy, which prevents American aid from going to those who counsel women on the availability of abortion.\nAlexia Kelley, Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, informed CNA that there are \"many efforts underway and planned\" to show support for the incoming administration as well as to challenge it to keep its abortion reducing commitment.\nAdditionally, Kelley mentioned that the topics of how to help the poor, homeless, children and the sick during these times of economic hardship were also raised.\nBoth Salt and Kelley confirmed to CNA that there was no one officially representing the Catholic Church present at the meeting, although they thought that an Obama team representative had met with key bishops at the USCCB.\nBishop Thomas Wenski, a member of the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on International Justice and Peace, reacted to the meeting by saying, \"while the Obama transition team is free to meet with anyone they wish\u2026the fact is that the only ones who speak for the Catholic Church are the bishops.\n\"If the transition team wished to telegraph a message that their intention is to marginalize the bishops then there is reason for some serious concern regarding the relationship between the future Obama administration and this nation's 60 million Catholics,\" Wenski said.\nCatholic scholar and author George Weigel expressed his doubts about the meeting\u2019s make up. \"If the Obama transition team thinks that meeting with the refugees from the Catholic revolution that never was is a way to open a dialogue with the Catholic Church in the United States, they're far less clever than I think they are. This strikes me as simply a pay-off to people who, from the Obama campaign's point of view, helped with the ground game in 2008.\"\nThe proof of the social justice groups\u2019 commitment to promoting Catholic concerns will be in \"how these \u2018Platform for the Common Good\u2019 folks help the rest of the Catholic Church defeat the Freedom of Choice Act and maintain the Bush administration's AIDS and malaria-reduction initiatives in Africa, which has helped millions more poor people than any of these groups has ever managed to do,\" Weigel explained to CNA.\nBishop of Madison Robert Morlino also added that the transition team must do more to dialogue with the Catholic Church. \"Recognizing the stark contrast between the positions on abortion of the President-elect and the teachings of the Catholic Church, it would be a mistake for the President-elect's transition team to pretend that this meeting satisfied his promise of dialoguing with the Catholic community,\" he said.\nThe bishop of Phoenix, Thomas Olmsted, also weighed-in on the meeting by addressing what a Catholic organization should be emphasizing. He told CNA that \u201cBeing 'right' on any number of other issues will never outweigh the taking of human life through abortion. It would be my hope that any group calling themselves 'Catholic' would make this message abundantly clear, and express grave concern over the possibilities that the new administration may increase funding for abortions with public money or even erode conscience protections for Catholic hospitals and healthcare workers.\"\nFinally, Brian Burch, who heads a group of four lay Catholic organizations in the political, legal, research and educational fields, also expressed misgivings about the ability of the social justice consortium to rein in Obama\u2019s policies.\n\"We are pleased to hear that the Obama transition team is interested in talking with Catholics, but caution that such conversations must be weighed against his reported plans on abortion policy, including his Cabinet selections thus far. Specifically, we remain concerned that the new Administration is composed of leading abortion advocates who are preparing to overturn a large number of existing pro-life laws, while proving hundreds of millions of new taxpayer dollars for abortion.\n\"The fact that transition officials are consulting a select group of Catholic organizations who supported Obama's candidacy is not surprising. Whether these groups, some of whom claim to adhere to Catholic teaching, are able to hold him accountable on the issue of life, remains doubtful.\"",
    "wm_text": "\n\nNot only has the Obama-Biden administration confirmed that life begins at conception, as I have stated before it is now clear that the administration will consider the unborn a full member of the family and therefore, it will seek to outlaw the crime of infanticide \u2014 even though infanticide is currently legal and even the Democrat-dominated House passed the law which includes the full language to make it a crime.\n\nFor example, I learned from LifeNews that Obama\u2019s health care plan includes language that would criminalize a medical provider who would provide the common medical procedure of inducing labor when the mother\u2019s life is jeopardized: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to perform an abortion upon a woman who is a survivor of, or who has suffered from, suicide, self-inflicted strangulation or who has caused, attempted to cause, or who has failed to prevent, her own pregnancy from causing her own death.\u201d Such an interpretation would make it illegal for a woman to have an abortion in the U.S. just because her doctor believes the pregnancy could endanger her life \u2014 as the woman\u2019s life is the true priority \u2014 and abortions would in fact be considered to be murder since the woman\u2019s life is the only thing being considered \u2014 not the life of the unborn.\n\nObama\u2019s health care plan includes language that would criminalize a medical provider who would provide the common medical procedure of inducing labor when the mother\u2019s life is jeopardized: 'It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to perform an abortion upon a woman who is a survivor of, or who has suffered from, suicide, self-inflicted strangulation or who has caused, attempted to cause, or who has failed to prevent, her own pregnancy from causing her own death.'\n\n\u201cBecause of the potential for unintended pregnancy, the department shall establish health insurance and other coverage",

    "text": "Steven Spielberg has Ready Player One officially out in theaters today and Carl's Jr. tried to get in on the marketing fun by renaming their new charbroiled sliders to \"SpielBurgers.\" The legendary director caught wind of the fast food chain's publicity stunt and quickly shut it down after admitting that the sliders tasted \"pretty good.\" Though Carl's Jr. never officially renamed their product, they're pretty happy that they got some kind of reaction out of Steven Spielberg with a semi-endorsement.\nCarl's Jr. posted a bunch of spoof videos on Twitter advertising the name change of their sliders to the \"SpielBurgers\" to help promote Ready Player One and their new product. The videos each take on some of the director's most famous work, from E.T. to Jurassic Park. The fast food chain even decided to take their guerilla campaign to the next level when they had some of the \"SpielBurgers\" delivered to Amblin Entertainment yesterday, which prompted Steven Spielberg to record a response video and post it to Twitter.\nThe fast food chain tweeted over the weekend about the name change in honor of Ready Player One and noted that Steven Spielberg hadn't signed off, but that they \"assume that he's cool with it.\" In addition to the burgers, an employee even left a letter on an Amblin executive's car. After Carl's Jr. delivered the \"SpielBurgers\" to Amblin, the director announced a cease and desist to the fast food chain after sort of complimenting the taste of their creations. Spielberg had this to say.\n\"It has recently come to my attention that Carl's Jr. wants to rename their charbroiled sliders SpielBurgers and they're pretty good, but I'm passing. Cease and desist. You can't do it - sorry, guys.\"\nThe publicity stunt worked out perfectly for Carl's Jr. They knew that Steven Spielberg would never sign off on the deal, but if they got any response from him, it would be well worth it. Not only did Spielberg respond, he recorded a video that stated that \"SpielBurgers\" were pretty good, resulting in free promotion for the fast food chain and Ready Player One. Obviously, Carl's Jr. is pretty happy with the outcome that they orchestrated. Though the note on the executive's car was a tad bit creepy.\nAs for official partnerships, Ready Player One teamed up with the extremely popular HQ Trivia app for a record breaking prize of $250,000. The trivia game will take place tonight, March 28th at 6:30 PM Pacific and 9:30 PM Eastern, to celebrate the release of the movie. As for Steven Spielberg actually eating Carl's Jr., that has to be a bit of a white lie. One cannot imagine one of the most legendary directors of all time eating that type of fast food, even though our president mows down McDonald's more than once a week. You can check out the brilliant marketing plan to promote fast food and Ready Player One below, courtesy of the Carl's Jr. Twitter account."

    "text": "The democratization of data is a real phenomenon, but building a sustainable data democracy means truly giving power to the people. The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. And this seems a lot more like a dictatorship than a democracy \u2014 a benevolent dictatorship, but a dictatorship nonetheless.\nThese individuals and companies aren\u2019t entirely bad, of course, and they\u2019re actually necessary. Apps that help predict what we want to read, where we\u2019ll want to go next or what songs we\u2019ll like are certainly cool and even beneficial in their ability to automate and optimize certain aspects of our lives and jobs. In the corporate world, there will always be data experts who are smarter and trained in advanced techniques and who should be called upon to answer the toughest questions or tackle the thorniest problems.\nLast week, for example, Salesforce.com introduced a new feature of its Chatter intra-company social network that categorizes a variety of data sources so employees can easily find the people, documents and other information relevant to topics they\u2019re interested in. As with similarly devised services \u2014 LinkedIn\u2019s People You May Know, the gravitational search movement, or any type of service using an interest graph \u2014 the new feature\u2019s beauty and utility lie in its abstraction of the underlying semantic algorithms and data processing.\nThe problem, however, comes when we\u2019re forced to rely on these people, features and applications to decide how data can affect our lives or jobs, or what questions we can answer using the troves of data now available to us. In a true data democracy, citizens must be empowered to make use of their own data as they see fit and they must only have to rely apps and experts by choice or when the task really requires an expert hand. At any rate, citizens must be informed enough to have a meaningful voice in bigger decisions about data.\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a whole new breed of startups trying to empower the data citizenry, whatever their role. Companies such as 0xdata, Precog and BigML are trying to make data science more accessible to everyday business users. There are next-generation business intelligence startups such as SiSense, Platfora and ClearStory rethinking how business analytics are done in an area of HTML5 and big data. And then there are companies such as Statwing, Infogram and Datahero (which will be in beta mode soon, by the way) trying to bring data analysis to the unwashed non-data-savvy masses.\nCombined with a growing number of publicly available data sets and data marketplaces, and more ways of collecting every possible kind of data \u2014 personal fitness, web analytics, energy consumption, you name it \u2014 these self-service tools can provide an invaluable service. In January, I highlighted how a number of them can work by using my own dietary and activity data, as well as publicly available gun-ownership data and even web-page text. But as I explained then, they\u2019re still not always easy for laypeople to use, much less perfect.\nStatwing spells out statistics for laypeople.\nCan Tableau be data\u2019s George Washington?\nThis is why I\u2019m so excited about Tableau\u2019s forthcoming IPO. There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau. It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself. Tableau\u2019s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I\u2019ve already referenced.\nAssuming it begins its publicly traded life flush with capital, Tableau will not just be financially sound \u2014 it will also be in a position to help the burgeoning data democracy evolve into something that can last. More money means being able to develop more features that Tableau can use to bolster sales (and further empower business users with data analysis), which should mean the company can afford to also continually improve its free service and perhaps put premium versions in the hands of more types of more non-corporate professionals for free.\nTableau is already easy (I made this) \u2014 but not easy enough.\nThe bottom-up approach has already proven very effective in the worlds of cloud computing, software as a service and open-source software, and I have to assume it\u2019s a win-win situation in analytics, too. Today\u2019s free users will be tomorrow\u2019s paying users once they get skilled enough to want to move onto bigger data sets and better features. But the base products have to be easy enough and useful enough to get started with, or companies will only have a lot of registrations and downloads but very few avid users.\nAnd if Tableau steps ups its game around data democratization, I have to assume it will up the ante for the company\u2019s fellow large analytics vendors and even startups. A race to empower the lower classes on the data ladder would certainly be in stark contrast to the historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite. That\u2019s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind.\nFeature image courtesy of Shutterstock user Tiago Jorge da Silva Estima.\nGreat article Derrick \u2013 appreciating your work on the topic here on GigaOm.\nWe\u2019re seeing wider availability of reasonably priced BI and visualization software tools to help us understand that harnessing all this data is possible \u2013 and I think even consumers are beginning to understand the value of all the data, and the ability to make meaning from it. One part of the puzzle that\u2019s missing from what I can see is the education \u2013 knowledge transfer of how individuals can use the tools, what good data science methods are, and how data citizens can actively contribute to the larger data analysis community. I see movements like the Open Data/Open Gov folks, and events like the NYC Big Apps hackathon as part of the solution \u2013 but as individuals, where do we go to take part? What is the role of an informed, curious citizen in this? More venues exist for learning some of the \u2018how\u2019 to make sense of big data as an individual taking a course online, but I\u2019m not seeing a vision from anyone talking about how to connect all of the dots. To make sense of data, we need the tools, the practitioners, the analysis of the problems, but we also need a vision of how all of these will work. If anyone has ideas of who\u2019s got that vision, I\u2019d love to hear it.\nI feel one of the biggest impediments to the democratization of data is access. Most people know what they would like to answer, and how the data needs to be shaped to achieve that, but getting the data to do the actual analysis with can be one of the most difficult aspects.\nThis is a bit of a plug, but we\u2019re working on enabling data access that is easily attainable by everyone. Our platform http://www.quandl.com is a \u201csearch engine for data\u201d that is able to fetch time series data from a disparate sets of sources, and provide it in a simple searchable form that allows users to extract, validate, format, merge, graph, and share it however they want.\nBy providing the underlying data for analysis tools like Tableau, Statwing, and many others, we feel we can help to create the tool stack that empowers people to create a sustainable DIY data culture.\nIn every company I\u2019ve worked at, I\u2019ve seen this major divide between IT analysts and Business users. Part of it was cultural, but a major reason was as you point out: \u201ca historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite\u201d. The business user typically was left to use Excel to prepare and analyze data.\nIt took 15+ years, but thanks to new players like Tableau, Spotfire and Qlikview which were sold primarily to the business user and focused on ease of use, the data democratization process has resulted in a power shift to the business user. Some IT departments have now come around and are trying to accommodate these \u201cshadow IT\u201d projects by providing IT support and giving Tableau users limited access to enterprise data stores.\nAs for upping the ante for the traditional players, it has happened already. Over the last two years, the larger vendors have responded with products like Visual Insight (MicroStrategy), Visual Intelligence (SAP), PowerPivot (MicroSoft), JMP (SAS) etc. taking aim at this segment of the market. The Big Data market is still new, but the trend to build user-friendly (or at the very least, SQL-aware) tools on top of Hadoop is also hitting its stride.\nOne good thing coming out of this data democratization is the realization that it has to be supported by a Data Governance effort. Otherwise we\u2019ll see the unfortunate return of a major problem with data democracy: data chaos. Previously it would have meant comparing and reconciling two Excel spreadsheets, now we may end up reconciling the findings from two Tableau workbooks.\nThanks for the comment, and for making a really good point about data governance. Obviously, that\u2019s not too big a concern for personal data use, but competing findings from lots of disparate data sets would be problematic.",
