In my opinion, at $2/share the company is poised to repeat miraculous gains in a relatively near future. Only twice in the past eleven years has this stock been this low. Its price has climbed up to as high as $10 in times past! With the company's current pipeline, a plausible economic crisis (something this sector can be relatively immune to and could therefore draw investors), and add in the fact that ArQule is presenting at the RBC Capital Markets Global Healthcare Conference coming this Tuesday... it seems likely that something positive, no matter how minute, will likely send this stock up quick. Dilution, or other bad things could happen, but I'm having a difficult time seeing it happen with this company. The fundamentals on this stock are shaky, though.

The other panels compare the scale of Earth to the eruptions. Red shows superheated gas held together by magnetic fields. The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded. There were three eruptions, each triggering the next.\nThe gas was heated to 36 million degrees Fahrenheit (20 million Celsius) before being flung up into the solar atmosphere at 90,000 mph (40 kilometers per second).\n\"We have observed the flows of hot gas for the first time, enabling us to see that several small flares combine to create a major explosion,\" Harra said. \"This may eventually enable us to predict large flares before they erupt.\"\nNot all solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, and nobody knows for sure why.\n\"It must be a combination of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic configuration that will allow field lines to be opened and hence the release of gas,\" Harra said.\nThe observations were made with SOHO spacecraft, a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency. The results were presented last week at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society.", "wm_text": "\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A chance to make their voices heard in a state that has silenced them for too long.\n\u201cDuring the phone call on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Ryan, who had campaigned heavily for Mr. Johnson in 2016, posed an essential question, according to the senator: \u2018What are you going to need?\u2019 What Mr. Johnson needs \u2026 is for the bill to treat more favorably small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities -- businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed at rates for individuals. Such entities, including Mr. Johnson\u2019s family-run plastics manufacturing business, account for more than half of the nation\u2019s business income, and the senator says the tax bill would give an unfair advantage to larger corporations.\n-- IT\u2019S WORTH NOTING: This is hardly the first time Johnson has clashed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his GOP leadership team. He also fought with them over how the Obamacare repeal process played out. He is just the first Senate Republican out of the gate opposing the bill. Just because the House GOP tax overhaul was on the fast track and didn\u2019t face many hiccups, don\u2019t expect the same to be true in the Senate.\nFOR EXAMPLE\u2026 JAKE TAPPER talks with SEN.

If that provision stays in the tax bill, will that mean a \u2018no\u2019 vote from you?\u201d COLLINS: \u201cWell, first of all, I think we need to distinguish between taking away insurance from people who already have it, which is what the health care bill said we considered earlier this year would have done, versus removing a fine on people who choose not to have insurance. And that\u2019s \u2026 disproportionately 80 percent on those who make under $50,000.\nMORE TAX DRAMA IN THE STATES -- \u201cIn Democrat-led state capitals, GOP tax reform push could scramble fiscal plans,\u201d by Laura Nahmias in New York, Katherine Landergan in New Jersey and Carla Marinucci in California: \u201cThe Republican tax reform push in Washington is setting off budgetary alarm bells in high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey, in the latest political skirmish to pit national Republicans against Democratic state and big city leaders.\n\u201cWith Republicans intent on shrinking or repealing the state and local tax deduction, California officials are worried that the House-passed tax bill, and the emerging Senate measure, will force local governments to reduce taxes and make big cuts to schools and social services. In New York, where New York City and state revenues are heavily reliant on just a handful of wealthy tax filers, budget watchdogs fear federal tax changes could trigger the flight of those residents.
